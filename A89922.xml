         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And I am fully perſwaded it could never have

            <p>But as there is no good thing in the world which meeteth not with ſome contrarietie, no vertue that is not oppoſed, no proſperity that is not croſſed; I doubt not but it will find contradictions and obſtacles both at home and abroad; at home, from ſome evill Chriſtians, ſecret enemies of the peace and tranquillitie of this Church and Eſtate; abroad, from the Enemies of the truth; and every where, from envious and malicious ſpirits.</p>
            <p>But I truſt it ſhall be as the neſt of the little <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,</hi> which under the protection of the moſt High, contemneth the ſurging billows of the Ocean, and which though toſſed with the waves, remaineth ſtill victorious above the floods. Or rather as the
<pb facs="tcp:156624:4"/>
Rocks which cannot be moved with ſtormes, but continue firm againſt all the aſſaults of winds and tempeſts.</p>
            <p>So, I ſhall let it travell under thoſe favourable hopes with expreſſe charge to proclaim in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where it ſhall paſſe, the greatneſſe of your glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. While in the meane time, I ſhall endeavour to ſhelter my ſelf here from all dangerous ſtormes under the ſhadow of your wings, to enjoy the ſweetnes of peace and happines which this whole Land expecteth from your wiſdom, and one who for the glory of God hath ſought hither for refuge, (as I) may hope from your bountie.</p>
            <p>And there in greater ſecuritie than the Dove that is chaſed by the Hawks, doth find: being once gotten into the holes of the Rock, I ſhall meditate the reſt of my dayes the wonders of the Almighty, and earneſtly pray to him, that it would pleaſe him to poure out upon their royall Majeſties, and their Princely Progenie, upon your moſt Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Perſons, and this whole Land, all the heavenly and earthly bleſſings that can wiſh.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:156624:6"/>
ſpeake, and for whom I write this, hoping examples will be of greater power than words with you.</p>
            <p>For friendly <hi>Reader,</hi> I have been a long time even as you in the ſame blindneſſe and doubtings you are in; and becauſe I was told that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooved mee to beleeve without further enquiry, and have onely the good faith (as they ſay) of the Colliar, which is to referre himſelfe to the faith of his Curate without further examination: I aſſayed to doe the ſame, bending my will that way, but ſo ſoone as I began to have a little judgement, J had a thouſand combats in my minde in that blinde obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which J could not ſee grounded upon any ſure foundation. J heard of an holy Scripture, but J was almoſt twenty yeares old before J knew what it was: J was permitted yea, and recommended to reade and learne, even by heart, <hi>Virgil, Cicero, Homer,</hi> and <hi>Plutarch,</hi> all of them Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan &amp; prophane Authors and proper to teach paganiſme &amp; the Idolatry of the falſe gods; no man deſiring mee to reade or learne the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which the holy Ghoſt left to make us wiſe unto ſalvation, and to inſtruct us in Chriſtianitie and the worſhip of the true God, as the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet and rudiment of Chriſtians. Is not this a ſtrange malice or blindneſſe?</p>
            <p>All that was ſpoken to mee in matter of faith was, that it behooved mee to beleeve without further ſearch, and refer my ſelfe to the faith of our Teachers. And what? (did J often ſay in my ſelfe) If thoſe who lead us, be blinde or diſſemble the truth through perverſeneſſe, or for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intereſts;<note place="margin">Mat. 15.14.</note> the blind leading the blined both muſt fall into the ditch; if our Leaders will goe to hell and be damned, J ſhall then be as they referring my ſelfe to them: J ſaw they were but men full of infirmities and imperfections as others, that their words were words of men ſubject to deceit and lyes; where J did finde nothing ſure to ſettle a firme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, ſo that J did conclude in my ſelfe, that faith being a certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and beliefe, it could not be ſure but upon a certaine and infallible foundation; and ſo J concluded there was nothing but the Word of God alone, and not the word of man that could aſſure us of true faith, and of the way to ſalvation; and that that Word of God being left to us in the holy Scriptures, it was the dutie of every man to ſearch and examine, if the faith and doctrine preached were conformable to it, and that no wiſe and judicious man ſhould refer himſelfe to another; every one being to give an account for himſelfe in the day of Gods Judgement, and none received there to warrant and baile another.</p>
            <p>This then moved mee to compare the doctrine of faith which was taught mee, with that which Jeſus Chriſt did preach; and there J found
<pb facs="tcp:156624:6"/>
ſo great difference in many points, that it might be ſaid to be altogether another doctrine than that of the Sonne of God. Happy was it for mee J underſtood the Latine, as my Mother tongue; for J was above twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeares old, before J durſt reade or keepe by mee the Bible in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar tongue, under paine of greater Excommunication (ſaid they) then is pronounced againſt one who ſhould reade a Book of the Black Art, or kill his father or mother, and there is none but the Pope alone hath power to doe it, or can give Licenſe; Even ſo did J obtaine it by that means (but this by the way;) They produced indeed for every thing the holy Scripture, but for the moſt part in a meaning ſo far different from the truth, that there is no error, hereſie, nor diſſolutneſſe, which may not be grounded and maintained in like manner upon and by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures.</p>
            <p>J did heare them ſpeake of Traditions, and that we ought to ſubmit our ſelves to the meaning and judgement of the Church; but when J came to examine the Church, and the infallibilitie of thoſe Traditions, J found that all was reſolved in the judgement and head of the Pope a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, who being elected and choſen by ſuch humane or rather worldly or rather diabolicall means, ſo often deceived in his judgements, ſo ſubject to vices and infirmities, yea and ſo uncertaine of his owne ſalvation; I could not ſee how that could be a ſure ground of a firme beliefe, ſuch as ought to be that of our faith, there being no place in the holy Scripture that giveth him either right to judge or infallibilitie to doe the ſame; (as J ſhall ſhew more amply, with other things;) ſo that J did imagine all this to be onely an humane invention and deceit, flowing from the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and power of the Pope, ſo dazel the eyes of the ſimple and weaker underſtandings, and a refuge for want of the Word of God, to maintaine the doctrine taught in that Church.</p>
            <p>Thoſe conſiderations did ever ſencibly move me, and the more I grew in age and continued in the ſtudy and meditation of Theologie and holy Writings, the more alſo did increaſe the impreſſions and commotions they made in my ſpirit, and though often through ſcrupulous ſimplicitie J endeavoured to confirm my ſelfe, and baniſh thoſe doubts &amp; thoughts, according to the Command they gave me, yet the truth did appeare ſo ſtrong and evident, that J could not but ſuſpect the doctrine of that Church, and as thoſe doubts did multiply within mee, the curioſitie and deſire to finde out the truth was alſo augmented.</p>
            <p>And alſo becauſe J doe not remember to have met with any lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or judicious men, even of the Romiſh Church, which did not make mee to ſee in free Conferences, that they had the like doubtings, and
<pb facs="tcp:156624:7"/>
that they did not ſee ſufficient ground in the Word of God for most Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Romiſh beliefe.</p>
            <p>All thoſe Conſiderations being come to their maturitie, made mee reſolve to come with courage and other neceſſary Circumſtances out of the Kingdome of darkneſſe, where J had lived ſo many yeares, and give my ſelfe fully to follow the moſt holy truth; where I proteſt and confeſſe before God and the world, J have found more ſatisfaction and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilitie of minde, than ever J could meet withall ſo long as J was in the darkneſſe of ignorance and lyes.</p>
            <p>But that J have no ſooner taken my pen to give glory and praiſe to God, to whom it is due, and to edifie the Church; the indiſpoſition of the time paſt giving me but ſmall hopes of any good fruits from the ſeed J might have ſowed before; moved me to delay even to this time and occaſion; wherein the power of darkneſſe ſeemeth to be ſhaken in moſt Nations of the world; eſpecially, pietie, juſtice, and truth, being likely to flouriſh in this Noble Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> with greater libertie and ſplendour than ever, by the wiſdome and zeale of this incomparable Parliament, called by the great prudence of the high and mightie King <hi>Charles,</hi> and continued to this preſent, J have ſome hopes of more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull fruits, and that ſome may open their eyes more freely to ſearch and know the truth, and doe as J have done, as J wiſh they would doe. Beſides, J having been marveilouſly delivered not long ſince from a hard captivitie of ten moneths, occaſioned by the onely treachery and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie of my younger brethren much obliged to me. But as Papists angry at my converſion, contrary to all the oathes of ſecuritie they ſo often made to mee, (my occaſions calling me amongst them;) But God of his grace having not onely delivered mee, beyond all humane expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but alſo made me the Inſtrument to bring to the knowledge of his truth, my owne Keeper, who was of the ſame order with mee, and the meanes of my deliverance; J have now more obligation than ever to give glory to God, and wiſh that all men were in the ſtraight paths of the faith, to give more perfect praiſes to God for all his favours.</p>
            <p>It is not my intention to treat here amply of all the Controverſies of Religion, an infinite number of grave and worthy Authors having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done it, more learnedly, exactly and curiouſly, than I could, to whom J remit the curious, and thoſe who have the leaſure and deſire to be further informed.</p>
            <p>But that which I pretend in this little Treatiſe, is onely briefly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the reaſons which have moſt troubled and vexed my ſpirit, adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing you, that J ſhall onely uſe the Verſions in this Booke which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb facs="tcp:156624:7"/>
in the Romiſh Church; to wit, the vulgar they attribute to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Jerome</hi> for the Latine, and that of the Doctors of <hi>Lovaine</hi> for the <hi>French,</hi> to the end the ignorant who know not what the Scripture is, take not occaſion to ſtumble here, and ſay (as their cuſtome is) all is impoſture and deceit.</p>
            <p>God forbid, J ſhould ſeeke applauſe or glory of any thing (wee have no good but that which commeth from God;) but I may ſay truly J was not accounted ignorant in the Romiſh Church; for beſides the ſtudy of Philoſophy, and Theologie, and others, wherein J ſpent many yeares, J was imployed above twelve yeares in Preaching, by expreſſe Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Generall of the whole order of <hi>Capuchins,</hi> where J was; and by priviledge and eſpeciall Letters from the Congregation of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalls at Rome, J was the Popes Miſſionary above ſeven yeares; a favour imparted but to few, for the great and extraordinary power they have, moving jealouſie even almoſt to all the Biſhops. And though J have been a ſinner, full of imperfections, and will not nor cannot glorifie my ſelfe in any thing before God or men; yet the charges of Superioritie in divers Monasteries, of Deputie in many Provinciall Aſſemblyes, of Confeſſor in ſundry places, of Miſſionary in many Cantons, where J have been and was actually imployed when I left the Romiſh Church, evidence ſufficiently the opinion and eſtimation which was had of me in the order I was of; paſſing with ſilence the applauſe and affection of peoples in many Cities and Countryes, ſufficiently knowne to thouſands. But to God be the glory and honour, before whom I proteſt (worthy <hi>Reader</hi>) I ſhall write nothing here but the ſimple truth ſincerely, as J thinke and know it, according to the true feeling I have.</p>
            <p>Let no unreaſonable ſcruple, or vaine feare, divert you from reading this Treatiſe; for there is no Commandement under heaven, can hinder you to ſeeke your ſalvation, and to ſee and enquire if you be in the right way or not. You will reade willingly, a Comedie, a Roman, a booke of love or ſongs without ſcruple; Wherefore will you not reade this, that concernes your ſalvation? If the Pope forbids it, it is becauſe he is intereſſed; but none ought to be received Judge in his owne cauſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, have you never heard that of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſai. 15.3. Mat. 22.29.</note>

            </p>
            <p>And as I deſire nothing but your profit, and Gods glory, ſo ſhall you not ſee here any affectation of vaine eloquence; but onely ſtrong reaſons ſet down in ſo eaſie a ſtile, that the moſt ſimple may underſtand the ſame; and when you have conſidered my doctrine, J am aſſured you ſhall finde
<pb facs="tcp:156624:8"/>
it Orthodox and truly Catholike, altogether conformable to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, which is the onely Catholike veritie, and the onely intent of this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Now I having lived ſo long time, and converted amongst the Romiſh Church, and had ſo many occaſions and imployments to perceive and diſcover all the inventions, ſubtilities, abuſes and deceits thereof; I doubt not but J ſhall ſpeak many things unknowne to thoſe who have not lived amongst them; and many even of thoſe who lives amongst them are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of, and many whereof an infinite multitude of perſons, (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of good natures and well bred) take no notice at all, and many things which moſt men know ſufficiently and deplore, following the ſame onely by a forced neceſſitie; and many things alſo which divers malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly deſſemble, and deſire them not to be divulged.</p>
            <p>And if the light of the truth, which I purpoſe to ſet downe here, be hurtfull to the eyes of any man, queſtionleſſe that will onely be to the bleere-eyed, who have their ſight troubled with ſome malignant hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; and I am aſſured where it offendeth one, it will pleaſe thirtie. Although the Owles, which delight onely in the night and darkneſſe, cannot indure the light of the pleaſant Sunne, which God maketh to ſhine upon us; he leaveth not off for that to diſplay his beames upon the earth, whence daily we ſee he produceth an infinite number of rare and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veilous effects, and none can deny but that the Owles themſelves receive often much good thereby.</p>
            <p>J beſeech the great God of light, that the truth which I deſire to write may be profitable both to the ſicke and the whole, to the eyes well diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and thoſe that are not; and that this little Treatiſe, which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for all, may be profitable to all. J beg from my heart, the grace and bleſſing of God to that end; without which, J acknowledge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.7.</note> he who planteth, or he who watereth, is nothing, nor can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. To him therefore who is the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the beginning and the end, be all honour and glory, Amen.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>How the Romiſh Church acknowledgeth no other Judge in matters of faith but the Pope.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ne of the points which ever troubled my ſpirit moſt when I was of the Romiſh Church (and ought certainly to move every wiſe and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious man) is that they make the Pope of Rome alone infallible Judge of that faith which hath been taught &amp; preached to us by Chriſt and his Apoſtles; for howſoever they ſay and preach often to the ſimpler ſort, that it is the Church they hold for Judge; yet they confeſſe that that Church is principally ſeene in generall Councells, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Pope of Rome of the Councells neither are nor make up the Church, and have no power, certaintie, nor infallibilitie, but by the Pope alone.</p>
               <p>For although all the Biſhops, Patriarchs, and Cardinalls, yea, all the Chriſtians of the world were aſſembled, they make not up (they ſay) a Church, if the Pope be not preſent himſelfe, or by Deputy; becauſe holding him for head of the Church, they are
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:156624:9"/>
members without a head, which cannot make up a body, nor by conſequent a Church; and though they were all of one opinion in any point or Article of faith; all will be errour, if the Pope be of a contrary minde; and all that the Pope declares to be or not to be a point of faith, ought to be holden infallible, even though the reſt of the Church and Chriſtians be of a different opinion. And this is the common beliefe of the Romiſh Church, which is to be ſeene in thoſe Bookes they hold Orthodox, and preached in their publick Sermons: and though I know that many Prelates among them of great learning, and even ſo many famous Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities grudge mightily thereat; yet to publiſh or preach the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, is declared a matter of Excommunication and Anathema.</p>
               <p>Where yee may obſerve that it fareth not with the Councells of the Romiſh Church, (which they affirme to be the true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the faithfull) as it doth with Parliaments, or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall meetings of the States of Kingdomes; where he that precedeth hath but one voice, or two at the moſt, and can neither pronounce ſentence, nor make any act but by the pluralitie of voices and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages of the Aſſembly; ſo that whatſoever is ordered or enacted, is juſtly ſaid to be ordered and enacted by the Parliament or Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly.</p>
               <p>But it is not ſo in their Councells, for although they diſcuſſe (it may be) and examine the queſtion or point of beliefe; all that nevertheleſſe is but in ſhew and ceremony; for the Pope is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to ſtand to the opinions and voices of the reſt, but he alone pronounceth the ſentence, maketh the act, the point or Article of faith after his own fancy and mind; ſo that whatſoever is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded and enacted in matter of faith, can onely be ſaid to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by the Pope alone; the reſt having neither power to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, contradict, or cenſure him, nor refuſe his ordinances, except they will be reputed ſchiſmatickes and heretiques; for as he ſaith of himſelfe, he is the Vicar of God on earth, &amp; hath all the power of Jeſus Chriſt: and the Councell of <hi>Lateran</hi> aſcribe to him that of our Saviour in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18.<note place="margin">Mat. 28.18.</note> 
                  <hi>All power is given to me in heaven and earth.</hi> So it is wrongfully when they ſay the Church is Judge in matters of faith, but they ſhould ſay, it is the Pope alone; for ſuch indeed is their common doctrine, without which, men muſt beleeve amongſt them none can be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee how all the faith of the Romiſh Church is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on no other foundation than the head and judgement of the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:156624:9"/>
Biſhop of Rome, who for the moſt part is wickedly choſen by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct courſes, as ſimony and force, having often times proved ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, ungodly, abhominable, or at leaſt, politique and wiſe worldlings, (which is now adayes the condition moſt requiſite to make a Pope, who (as I ſhall moſt cleerly ſhew hereafter) hath no ſuperioritie, nor primacy over the Church, nor infallibilitie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed by the word and inſtitution of the Son of God, to be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judge in that (as many great Biſhops and Univerſities of the Romane Church) acknowledge ſufficiently, and I my ſelfe have heard it of them, and beleeve there is no man of good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in the world, to whom this doctrine doth not ſeeme al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together extravagant and voyd of all ſenſe and reaſon; yet it is the beliefe of the Church of Rome, without which (they ſay) none can be ſaved.</p>
               <p>For my part, I am perſwaded that whoſoever of the Romiſh Church, will conſider this point eſpecially, without paſſion and intereſt, and ſincerely ſeeke the truth, and his owne ſalvation, he cannot chooſe but yeeld as I have done, by the grace of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lights, who is never deficient in neceſſitie, and from whom I confeſſe doth proceed the great gift of faith.</p>
               <p>And if a Pagan ſhould be Judge of this controuerſie, and others, betwixt us and the Romiſh Church, I verily beleeve he would ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly condemne that Church of an unjuſt uſurpation and intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable errour in this point, as all the reſt (which by the grace of God we ſhall handle hereafter) and give ſentence in favour of my beliefe; which I proteſt, I have choſen, as the holieſt, pureſt, and moſt conformable to the doctrine and intentions of the Sonne of God and his Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>Now all the queſtion and difficultie of this point, conſiſteth the knowledge of thoſe two, which of them is the moſt certain rule and ſure Judge, moſt to be beleeved, and moſt proper for our faith, whether the Word of God, or the Pope of Rome and his traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The Church of Rome ſaith it is the Pope, but I hold with the Orthodox doctrine of this Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, that it is the Word of God. We ſhall ſhew hereafter, that our Saviour never gave that power and authoritie to the Pope, and therefore he cannot pretend it: but here I ſhall prove, that the holy Scripture is and ought to be the ſole rule and true Judge of our faith, grounding my ſelfe upon theſe following reaſons.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>That the holy Scripture is the onely Iudge, and rule ſufficient of Faith, and not the Pope, nor the Church.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THat man without queſtion, hath a true, catholick, and perfect faith, and is in a true beliefe, who beleeveth all that Chriſt Jeſus hath caught, and neither beleeves nor will beleeve more in the matter of faith; for the Son of God being that divine and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wiſdome and knowledge, which came into the world to ſave mankinde, and teach them true faith, hath preached and taught all that was neceſſary to faith and ſalvation; ſo he who beleeves all that Jeſus Chriſt hath taught, and nothing more, hath a true and perfect faith, and it is impietie to beleeve the contrary.</p>
               <p>Now it is true that whatſoever our Saviour did preach neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſalvation, is in the holy Scripture; and therefore the holy Scripture containes all the doctrine which is neceſſary to faith, and out of the written Word of God, nothing neceſſary to faith is to be ſought.</p>
               <p>For the Evangeliſts and holy Writers having undertaken by the motion and command of the holy Spirit, to write the actions and doctrine of the Son of God, for the inſtruction of all the faithfull that ſhould come after; it is not credible that they ſhould have written but a part, and omitted ſomething that was neceſſary to the perfect faith, and for the inſtruction and forming of a true Chriſtian; otherwiſe wee muſt ſay that the Goſpel is not the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, but onely a part of the Goſpel; and the New Teſtament is but a part of the New Teſtament of the Son of God.</p>
               <p>And note, that they were inſpired and commanded by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, to leave to Chriſtians and the whole Church, the life and doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, they being aſſiſted and helped by his ſpeciall grace to that end.</p>
               <p>Moreover, they have not onely within one chapter or two, but every one of them a great number, where undoubtedly they have had ſpace enough to comprehend all the doctrine neceſſary to ſalvation; and being foure that which one of them might have forgot and left out, might be ſupplied by the other; their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe being ſpecially to write the doctrine and precepts of the Son
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:156624:10"/>
of God, which were neceſſary to ſalvation; and if there were any thing more to be beleeved than that which is in the Evangeliſts, we muſt thinke that it ſhould be found in the Epiſtles either of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> or S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul,</hi> or ſome others of the chiefe Apoſtles, who all (except S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi>) were witneſſes of the doctrine and actions of the Apoſtles for many years, and many of their Sermons fully, might have touched it a little. So it is voyd of all reaſon, to thinke that Chriſt Jeſus did preach any other thing neceſſary to ſalvation, than that which is contained in the holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p>And if it were not in the holy Scriptures, it would follow that the Evangeliſts were faultie, and blame-worthy, and their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings imperfect; for that Author is greatly to be blamed, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expreſly commanded to write of ſome important ſubject, writes many things not neceſſary to his purpoſe, and paſſeth by more important and principall things; Now the Evangeliſts ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving undertaken by the command and motion of the holy Spirit, to write the doctrine of faith and ſalvation, preached by Jeſus Chriſt, for the inſtruction of the faithfull, they have written ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things not abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation (as a number of Parables, Hiſtories, and Miracles) for illuſtration or farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of fundamentall doctrines, and therefore wee muſt ſay that having written ſuch things, they have not omitted more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and important things; otherwiſe they were blame-worthy, and their writings would be imperfect.</p>
               <p>Now ſeeing there was but one holy Spirit that moved them, and guided their pens and their writings in this worke, one of them might have omitted ſomething which the holy Spirit would leave and teach us by the other, or by the writings of other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; but that there is any thing neceſſary to ſalvation omitted by them all, is more than can be beleeved by any Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, we ſee that the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles have left us ſufficient inſtructions in their writings, to lead us to perfection, and the practice of moſt excellent vertues; wee muſt beleeve them with better reaſon that they have given us ſufficient inſtructions to a perfect faith, which is the foundation of all vertue and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and without which there can be no perfection nor vertue: or otherwiſe it behooved us to ſay, that they taught men to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, not giving them ſufficiently inſtructions to be Chriſtians, which ſhould be an intolerable foppery.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:156624:11"/>Even as if a Maſon would teach his apprentiſe to build an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent houſe, not inſtructing him how to lay the foundation, or if a Maſter would inſtruct his ſcholar to read, not teaching him to know his letters.</p>
               <p>We muſt therefore believe that they having left us ſo noble and ſufficient inſtructions to become perfect, they have alſo left us ſufficient doctrine in their writings to obtain a perfect faith which is the neceſſary ground of all vertue and perfection; and doubtleſſe there are none but obſtinate and blinde perſons who will deny it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.15.</note>Doth not Saint Paul alſo ſpeaking to <hi>Timothy</hi> ſay, <hi>Thou hast learned from thy infancy the holy Scriptures which are able to make thee wiſe unto ſalvation, through the faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> We muſt ſay then that the holy Scriptures being able to make him wiſe to ſalvation contain all the doctrine neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; otherwiſe they could not make him wiſe to ſalvation (that is ſufficiently learned to be ſaved) for wiſdome to ſpeak properly is no other thing but a ſupereminent and excellent knowledge and Saint <hi>James</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Iam. 1.12.</note> that the word of God is able to ſave us, if it be able to ſave us, it is ſufficient to do the ſame, and contains all that is neceſſary to ſalvation, and therefore he who believes that which is in the holy Scripture and no more, hath the perfect faith.</p>
               <p>Yes, but (ſaith the Romiſh Church) Chriſt Jeſus remits us to the Church,<note place="margin">Matth. 18.16.</note> for it is ſaid, <hi>He who will not hearken to the Church let him be as a Pagan and a Publicane,</hi> that is, an excommunicate and anathema, therefore we muſt have recourſe to the church as Judge of all controverſie, and obey its determinations.</p>
               <p>The onely conſideration of the occaſion of this paſſage and the words themſelves may ſerve for a ſufficient anſwer: our Saviour preaching to his Diſciples and teaching them the method they ought to uſe in brotherly corrections, that it may be done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rules of charitie, ſpeaks to them in this manner. <hi>If thy brother have offended againſt thee, go and reprove him, thou and he alone, if he hearken unto thee, thou haſt wonne thy brother, but if he will not heare thee, take with thee one or two more, that out of the mouth of two or three wetneſſes every word may be establiſhed; and if he will not heare them, tell it unto the Church, and if he refuſe to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as an heathen and a publicane.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which ye ſee that Jeſus Chriſt ſpeaks onely of the order
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:156624:11"/>
which ought to be kept in fraternall correction, that is, we ought firſt to reprove in ſecret, next in the preſence of one or two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and then in caſe of obſtinacy declare it to the Church, and if he will not receive correction from the Church, let him be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as a pagan, that is, as a man without faith and religion, and as a publicane, that is, as one whom we muſt ſhun; for in thoſe times the publicanes were odious to all the people.</p>
               <p>But the Romiſh Doctors who make uſe of every thing to prove their doctrine, infer by thoſe laſt words, that all power is given to the Church, that we muſt have recourſe to the Church in every thing, and that all men ought to render perfect obedience to the Church in all things whatſoever; and note, that to have recourſe to the Church and to obey the ſame, is (in the ſchool of Rome) to have recourſe to the Pope and obey him;<note place="margin">Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius cap. <hi>3.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>That the holy Scripture is clear in that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns things neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ONe of the greateſt ſubtilties which the Romiſh Church hath found to hinder the people from reading the Scripture and to make them believe they have good reaſon for ſo doing, and perſwade them that the Scripture is an unſufficient rule and Judge of our faith, is that they alleadge the holy Scriptures to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and difficult to underſtand, and therefore chriſtians ought not to ruſh in upon the reading of them in the vulgar tongue (that is to ſay, which they underſtand beſt) without expreſſe permiſſion from the Pope, who ſaith he as the onely vicar of Jeſus Chriſt in the world and infallible, hath the true underſtanding of the Scripture, and that we cannot admit it for Judge and rule of faith, but onely the ſence and explication of the Church, that is of the Pope as I have ſhewed before.</p>
               <p>And to prove that the Scripture is hard to be underſtood they ſearch and pick out of purpoſe ſome obſcure paſſages which the moſt learned have much adoe to underſtand, but which are no wayes abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation, or if they were, they are ſufficiently and clearly enough explained in other places; as for example,<note place="margin">Pſal. 16.16. Pſal. 18.9. Hoſ. 12.1. Ezek. 19.10.</note> of the firſt part of Pſal. 16.16. <hi>The lines are fallen to me in pleaſant places, ſurely I have a goodly heritage;</hi> or this other pſal. 18.9. <hi>There went up a ſmoke out of his noſtrils, or fire out of his mouth devoured;</hi> or ſome other propheſie, as that of Hoſ. 12. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim feedeth on wind and followeth after the Eaſt wind:</hi> or Ezek. 19.10. <hi>Thy mother is like a vine in thy bloud planted by the waters;</hi> with an infinite number of the like, whereof the Prophets are full which are not neceſſary to ſalvation, or if they be neceſſary to ſalvation they are ſufficiently explained in other places; as that which Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 3.3.</note> 
                  <hi>Except a man be born again, be cannot enter into the kingdome of God,</hi> it is explained after in the fifth verſe, <hi>Except a man be born of water and of the ſpirit, he cannot enter into the kingdome of God;</hi> by which it is evident, Chriſt Jeſus would ſay, he who is born carnally of fleſh and is not regenerated ſpiritually by grace and faith, cannot enter into the kingdome of God; and ſo of other paſſages, which nevertheleſſe are very rare
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:156624:12"/>
in the new Teſtament in reſpect of that which is clear: under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of thoſe paſſages which are nothing in compariſon of the reſt, they make the ſimpler ſort believe that that the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſo obſcure and difficult, that it is a raſhneſſe extremely dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous for a chriſtian to think he can underſtand the meaning thereof (as a certain Dame at Court told me not long agoe not knowing me) and that no man ought to preſume to read the ſame in a vulgar tongue without expreſſe licenſe; the power whereof is reſerved by the Pope alone to diſtribute to all chriſtians, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not commonly be obtained without a great deal of money, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for thoſe who are remote from Rome, and that for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation thereof we muſt ſubmit to the Church, that is, to the Pope, as I have already ſhewed.</p>
               <p>So there is nothing but the explication of the Pope which can be a rule of faith, and which is infallible doctrine, and ſo the Pope maketh himſelf ſole Judge of all matters of faith, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that which is and that which is not: is not this an intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable extravagancy and worthy to be laught at by all men of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, ſeeing it is without warrant from Gods word, as may evidently appear.</p>
               <p>The Pope ſaith then the Scriptures are very obſcure and muſt not be holden for a rule of faith, nor be read for fear of miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the meaning.</p>
               <p>It is true that the Scripture conſiſting of many books written by divers authours at divers times, yea and in divers ages, and for divers ends, contain great diverſitie of ſtyle; for in ſome places it is hiſtoricall, in others propheticall, in ſome metaphoricall, in ſome morall, and in ſome mingled; and although all that is contained in thoſe diverſities of the holy Scriptures be written for our ſalvation (as ſaith Saint <hi>Paul</hi>) and we ought to make our profit thereof;<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> nevertheleſſe it is not to be doubted there both are and ought to be many obſcure things according to the nature and qualitie of the ſtyle in which the things are writren; for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies, parables and metaphors are ever accompanied with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity.</p>
               <p>But as our Saviour did make but a ſhort ſpeech upon earth, and having lived ſome 33 years preached but 3 or thereabouts, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which ſmall time he did preach and teach clearly and ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all things which were neceſſary to ſalvation, ſo that the moſt ſimple and ignorant might underſtand him and be ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:156624:13"/>
by his ſermons, Neither is there any but Reprobates who will ſay that God being come to ſave mankind did not give ſufficient inſtruction and clear enough for all men to be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Otherwiſe how could he have condemned <hi>Coraſin</hi> and <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaida</hi> and pronounced thoſe words againſt thoſe towns?<note place="margin">Matth. 11.20 &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>Wo be unto thee Coraſin, wo be unto thee Bethſaida; for if the mighty works which have been done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they had repented long ago in ſackcloth and aſhes; But I ſay unto thee, that it ſhall be more tolerable for the land of Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgement then for thee. And thou Capernaum, if the mighty works which have been done in thee had been done in Sodom, it would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained unto this day; But I ſay unto you that it ſhall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgement then for thee.</hi> Out of all queſtion thoſe cities would have received clear and ſufficient inſtructions for their ſalvation, otherwiſe he would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned them wrongfully. And if Chriſt Jeſus did preach clearly all things neceſſary to ſalvation, ſo that thoſe who followed him and heard him preaching might attain to perfect faith, The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts having ſet down his life and doctrine to us, eſpecially that which was neceſſary, and alſo endeavoured ſo farre as they were able to make the ſame known to us as clearly as our Saviour had preached it; otherwiſe they ſhould be very blameworthy and we ſhould have great reaſon to except againſt them, that our Saviour having preached a doctrine ſo clear and eaſie to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of all men, they ſhould have left it in ſo obſcure and hard terms, that none except the learned Divines were capable to underſtand: what not the learned Theologians? nay none (I ſay) in the world except one man, to wit the Pope, were able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and give its true meaning and explication. No no, it is blaſphemy to imagine it, but we muſt beleeve that the doctrine of the Evangeliſts being the ſame our Saviour preached, is left to us with all the facilitie and clearneſſe was poſſible, and ſufficient to inſtruct to true faith and ſalvation; neither can they be blamed of any defect, eſpecially being directed and aſſiſted by the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to that end.</p>
               <p>This impertinency alſo may be confuted by the onely reading of the Scripture, and thoſe who tax the ſame of obſcurity, or hardneſſe, do it undoubtedly out of malice or ignorance, never ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving read it, nor (it may be) never ſeen it; whereof are an infinite multitude in the Romiſh Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:156624:13"/>For certainly it is ſo clear, eſpecially in thoſe things which are neceſſary to our ſalvation, that the moſt ignorant and ſimple may underſtand it, and that oftentimes better then many learned; whoſe preſumption of their ſcience ſeeking ſubtile and curious interpretations in the ſimple words of our Saviour, beyond the purity and ſincerity of his intentions, are by his juſt judgement deprived of the true meaning of the ſame.</p>
               <p>As the Sonne of God himſelf ſaith in thoſe words;<note place="margin">Mat. 11.26.</note> 
                  <hi>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them unto babes: tis ſo, Father, becauſe ſuch hath been thy good pleaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And be aſſured, no man how ignorant ſoever, (providing he hath common ſence) ſhall ever reade the holy Scripture with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of ſimplicitie, and a mind onely deſirous to ſeek the way and means of ſalvation; but the holy Spirit who hath indited the ſame, will give him with a ſingular conſolation and ſatisfaction, an eaſie and clear knowledge of all things neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>
               <p>But if any paſſages ſomewhat hard be found, (which is very rare in the Evangeliſts) they may be paſſed over, as not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary, or rather for greater ſatisfaction, the opinion of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men may be asked about it: nor muſt we marvell, if ſometimes we find diverſity in their explications, for being matters not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary, nor touching the eſſence of Faith, the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie in ſuch points is not of great importance.</p>
               <p>But to ſay, that we muſt inſtruct all, and not read it for fear of miſtaking ſome things, is a meer invention of the Romiſh Church, or rather of the Biſhop of Rome, who deſiring to eſtabliſh many articles of Faith, to maintain his authority, and the greatneſſe &amp; riches of his eſtate, and Clergy; and ſeeing nothing clear in the holy Scripture to authorize his doctrine, hath gone about to make Chriſtians beleeve that the Scriptures were obſcure, and that it belongs to him onely to declare their true meaning, and determine that which belongeth, or belongeth not to faith, and that they ought not ſo much as once preſume to read them.</p>
               <p>Further, he hath ſtraightly forbidden them under pain of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathema, and an eternall curſe, fearing leſt the people coming once to read them, ſhould there find the condemnation of his falſe doctrine; and the more prohibitions there are, the more al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is the gain and profit he maketh thereby, upon thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire a diſpenſation: and verily it ſeemeth that the doctrine of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:156624:14"/>
Romiſh Church aimeth onely at greatneſſe and profit; ſo was the doctrine of indulgencies, purgatory, invocation of Saints, and confeſſion founded, with others the like, which we ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain more amply hereafter.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, they ſay the Scripture is a dumb rule, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inſufficient to be Judge, (which is a great injury done to the word of God, and againſt both reaſon and practiſe) for although the Kings edicts be in paper, and have no voice, notwithſtanding they have as great power amongſt the good ſubjects, as if they were pronounced out of the Kings mouth, and there is no man of underſtanding, who will eſteem them leſſe for that, to be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent rules and judges for matters contained therein.</p>
               <p>When God commandeth to have no other gods but him, nor to have no ſtrange gods before his face; is this a dumbe rule? and hath it not as great power as when God pronounced it to the Prophet <hi>Moſes</hi> upon Mount Sinai? certainly a law hath as much or more force being put in writing, and ſigned with the Kings hand, or his Secretaries; as if it were pronounced out of his mouth: and if the King write or pronounce an act, it is ever the ſame act, and hath the like force.</p>
               <p>It is therefore wrongfully, and without reaſon they tax the word of God, as an inſufficient rule or judge, becauſe it is onely written: for it hath the ſame power and force, as if God did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it every day from his mouth; and ſo ought we to receive and reſpect it. Now let us ſee if the commandment not to reade the Scriptures, be juſt or not; for the conſideration thereof is of great importance.</p>

                  <p>That the holy Scripture is given us by God, to read and meditate in the ſame, and that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of the Pope to read it, is altogether unjuſt, and contrary to the will of God.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>A Malefactour who knoweth his fact to be condemned by the law, apprehendeth nothing more, than that the Judge caſt his eye upon that Law, wherein he knoweth his condemnation
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:156624:14"/>
to be written; ſo I perceive that the Pope ſeeing there is nothing that condemns his doctrine ſo much as the holy Scripture, and the word of God, feareth nothing more than that this Scripture come to be knowne and conſidered; for which cauſe he hath done all he was able, and planted his fierceſt Batteries to hinder the reading thereof.</p>
               <p>And in the laſt generall Councell at <hi>Trent,</hi> where many Canons were made concerning bad and dangerous Books, and many clauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and degrees of thoſe Books, the holy Scripture is placed in the firſt clauſſe, and in the firſt Chapter, as one of the moſt pernicious and dangerous Books in the world; and by thoſe Canons they who ſhall reade it in the vulgar tongue, muſt incurre as great and greater malediction and Anathema, as thoſe who ſhould kill their father and mother, or reade the Alkoran, or the moſt wicked, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and deteſtable Booke in the world; for a ſimple Prieſt or a Biſhop can abſolve a man from exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication for other things, but to read the Bible in a vulgar tongue (that is, in <hi>Engliſh, French, Spaniſh,</hi> or <hi>Dutch</hi>) there is none except the Pope himſelfe, or his Deputy can abſolve him; and to have it in his houſe, or to reade it, in <hi>Spaine, Italy,</hi> or where the Inquiſition reigneth, is a fact that deſerveth burning; and the permiſſion can be given by none but by the Pope; ſo neither the Prieſts, nor Doctors of the Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, nor all the Biſhops of the world, who call themſelves the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours of the Apoſtles, nor the Cardinalls of Rome themſelves have power to reade the Scriptures, and give Licenſe to others; there is but one in the world, to wit, the Pope, who hath that power, becauſe he holdeth that none but himſelfe in the world can underſtand it well, and know the meaning of it: this ſeemeth to me a ſtrange policy.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe the Pope, who is but a man, and is thought ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily to be inclined to his pleaſures, as much as any man in the world, will not be troubled with thoſe who aske Licenſe to reade the Scriptures, he hath appointed at Rome a certaine company of Cardinalls, called the Congregation of Cardinalls in matters of faith, to whom he hath given permiſſion to reade it, and power to give Licenſe to thoſe who aske, and whom they ſhall thinke capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble through the whole world.</p>
               <p>So thoſe of <hi>France, Spaine, England, Hungary,</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> yea even of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> who would have Licenſe to reade the Scriptures, muſt (according to the Canon of that Councell)
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:156624:15"/>
write or ſend to Rome, either by themſelves, or by exchange, and obtaine Licenſe in writing (for that condition is expreſſed in the Prohibition, and I my ſelfe had it in that ſort;) which doubtleſſe cannot be had in remote Countryes, without great paines, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and time; ſo that by this means, the poore (though they were the moſt capable and judicious, the moſt zealous and affectionate Chriſtians in the world) are deprived of reading the Word of God (it may be for ever) in the Romiſh Church.</p>
               <p>I know indeed a great many Biſhops in that Church ſcorne that prohibition, as altogether unjuſt and ridiculous, and calling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles, thinke they have ſufficient au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie by their office and dignitie to reade the Scriptures, and to give licenſe to thoſe of their Dioceſſe whom they eſteeme capable without ſending to the Pope, whom many among them hold one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for their equall. But ſuch is the order of that Councell held by them to be generall, and called moſt holy, and hath been confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſince, and made ſtricter by an expreſſe Bull; ſuch is alſo the practiſe of all the Orders, and the reſolution of their Canoniſts, and the abſolute will of the Biſhop of Rome; ſo that if he be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Biſhop, and have power to command over all Chriſtians (as they affirme in the Romiſh Church) this ought to have place and be obeyed by the Papiſts, under paine of eternall damnation and Anathema.</p>
               <p>This is alſo ſo exactly obſerved almoſt every where among them, that hardly ſhall a Bible be found in an hundred houſes; yea there are many Prieſts and Paſtors, in whoſe houſes it is not to be ſeene (&amp; it may be was never ſeen) and who have never read it. I ſay not onely not wholly, but who have never read one whole Chapter, if it be not (perchance) in their Brevier, or in the Booke of the Maſſe, or other Books, where ſome little parcells may be found.</p>
               <p>If there be any Chriſtians found who reade it in the vulgar tongue, which they underſtand beſt; beſides the curſes and Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themaes that are thundred againſt them by the Romiſh Church, they are impriſoned and in danger of death, where the Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in force, and are accounted commonly every where as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes, or people who have an evill opinion of the Church, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were an impreſſion and tranſlation approved by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>Thence out of all queſtion doth proceed that great ignorance which is to be ſeen amongſt the people in the Church of Rome,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:156624:15"/>
there not being ten amongſt an hundred inſtructed ſufficiently to ſalvation, or that can give a ſufficient reaſon of their beliefe; I ſay even according to the doctrine of their own Church.</p>
               <p>This is ſpecially to be ſeen in the Countrey Pariſhes, and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Cities alſo, where though there be more frequent preaching, the Communion and confeſſion be oftner haunted, yet the people are nothing the better inſtructed in the faith for all that; nor know they ſufficiently that which concerneth their ſalvation; this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect can be imputed to no other cauſe, but the forbidding the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scriptures, which is the Booke of life, appointed by God for the inſtruction and conſolation of the faithfull; for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they make many Catechiſmes, and the Preachers endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour often to inſtruct the people in their beliefe; they are but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the wiſer, or better inſtructed for all that; for they nouriſh them not with the Book of life, to wit, the Word of God, which is the true bread of the faithfull, inſtituted by God for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and comfort.</p>
               <p>Where on the contrary in the Churches of the reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, there is not one almoſt but he can give a reaſon of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, if he have any judgement, and is inſtructed in the faith; though often they cannot reade, but have onely heard the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture read; and you ſhall finde in many places an infinite number of ſimple and ignorant people in humane learning, who know the Bible a great deale better than many great Biſhops in Popiſh Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, and famous Preachers among them; which I proteſt I have often ſeen with great admiration, as did many others alſo, to the great confuſion (queſtionleſſe) of the Romiſh Church, what ever they can alledge.</p>
               <p>As for my part, I confeſſe I could never finde any ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in that prohibition for reading the Scriptures; for if the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we call the Old Teſtament, is the ſame Word of God that was left unto us by <hi>Moſes,</hi> by the Prophets, and ſervants of God (as is moſt certaine) I ſee nothing more common in that Word than ſtraight commands to reade, heare, meditate, ruminate and obſerve the ſame, to write it upon the poſts of our houſes, and carry it tyed to our fingers; that is, to have it continually before our eyes, and in our hearts: I ſhould make too large a volume, contrary to my intention, if I ſhould cite all the paſſages which are clearly to be ſeen in it to this effect: peruſe but the Bookes of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> and <hi>Numbers,</hi> the <hi>Proverbs of Salomon,</hi> the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:156624:16"/>
divers of the Prophets. All thoſe commandements and exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are given to all men, as well the learned as the ignorant, the poore as the rich, which cannot be underſtood of the Bible onely in a ſtrange tongue, but in a language that is beſt underſtood of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one (which is the vulgar.)</p>
               <p>That which is ſaid of the old Teſtament, may be more eaſily proved of the New, which is as the laſt Will Chriſt Jeſus our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath left us as his children; by which we muſt know his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and that which he deſireth us to doe to become worthy children of ſo good a Father, and to poſſeſſe the inheritance he hath purchaſed for us through his merits and bloud.</p>
               <p>Is there any man of judgement in the world, who can beleeve that he hath left us his Commandements, laſt Will and intentions, as altogether needfull to ſalvation, and not ſuffer us to reade the ſame; and that there was but one man in the world (to wit, the Pope) who had power to reade and explaine the ſame to others? Where is that ſo important prohibition ſet downe? Where is it ſo ſpoken? have not we as much part in the inheritance of Chriſt Jeſus, as our Father the Pope? By what right ſhould Chriſtians be deprived of the reading of the will and intentions of their Father? the will of God and his holy Commandments, which they ought to know and doe under paine of eternall damnation; Is there any power or authoritie under heaven that can hinder them? ſeeing God enjoyneth and commandeth the ſame, the thing being of ſo great importance to them, that none can be anſwerable for them in the day of Judgement? Is there any power on earth that can diſpence them? No, no, this prohibition is altogether unjuſt, and againſt both reaſon and the will of God.</p>
               <p>Yes, but ſome will ſay, the intentions of God, his Teſtament, and the holy Scripture are made knowne to Chriſtians by the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons which they call commonly the Word of God; It is true, the preaching of the ſervants of God, and Orthodox Preachers, are highly to be eſteemed; for they may learne and profit much there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; but there is great difference betwixt a mans and the Word of God; becauſe the Word of God is altogether divine and holy, and the infallible truth, of which we cannot doubt; and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of Preachers, howſoever they be called the Word of God, are not (to ſpeak properly) the Word of God, except onely that which is ſimply produced out of the holy Scripture, the reſt are onely humane words, ſubject to faults and defects, to paſſions and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:156624:16"/>
errors (eſpecially in the Romiſh Church) where many among them cite oftner <hi>Plato, Seneca, Plutarch,</hi> or ſome other, than they doe the holy Scriptures; and if they cite them, it is ſo far from the true meaning thereof, that they may rather be tearmed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, than piouſly cited and ſincerely explained.</p>
               <p>Finally, it is to deceive Chriſtians, to make them beleeve that Sermons ſhould ſerve them in place of reading the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; the Word of God is filled with a better ſpirit, than all the beſt Sermons in the world; for there it is the holy Spirit, who ſpeaketh to us, whereof we ought not to doubt, nor can we enter into any ſuſpition of deception; but Sermons being onely the words of men, inſtituted to inſtruct and ſtirre us up to God, wee ought indeed to reſpect them much, and heare them willingly; but we are not obliged to heare and receive them with ſo great reſpect as the holy Scriptures; and we ought alſo to examine and confer them with the Scriptures; as did thoſe Noble <hi>Bereans,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> preaching, to ſee if that which he ſaid unto them was conformable to the Word of God, as it is ſet downe <hi>Act.</hi> 17.11. neither did S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Act. 17.11.</note> nor any other ever blame them for that action.</p>
               <p>And our Saviour himſelfe reproaching the <hi>Jewes,</hi> that being ſent from God his Father, they would neither receive him, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in him, ſaith to them, <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi>

When <hi>Philip</hi> went out of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by the commandement of the Lord,<note place="margin">Act. 8.27.</note> to goe for <hi>Gaza,</hi> he did meet with the Eunuch of the Queene of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> who being a man that ſought the Kingdome of God, did reade the old Teſtament; the Apoſtle did not reprove him for reading the Scripture, but explained to him a Propheſie of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> that was difficile to be underſtood; and that reading was a means and helpe to finde true faith, and to embrace Chriſtian Religion. In the time then of Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles, the reading of the holy Scripture was not forbidden, neither was it thought to be pernicious.</p>
               <p>The Romiſh Church commendeth alſo S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Cecill</hi> whoſe feaſt they keep as of a great Virgin and Martyr, for carrying continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in her boſome the Books of the Evangeliſts; and they hold ſhe lived in the times of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Clement,</hi> who is eſteemed one of the firſt Biſhops of Rome, after the death of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter:</hi> The Scriptures then were not as yet prohibited, nor the reading of the ſame thought pernicious, or dangerous to the ſimple ſort; for ſhe was but a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple young damſell, brought up in Paganiſme.</p>
               <p>As we reade of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Jerome,</hi> who lived about three hundred yeares after, that he did recommend nothing to <hi>Paula</hi> and <hi>Euſtochium,</hi> Mother and daughter, both great Romane Dames, ſo much as the aſſiduous reading of the holy Scriptures, and that it ſhould be their moſt ordinary ſtudy and frequent meditations.</p>
               <p>By theſe and an infinite of other examples, which I might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, if I feared not tediouſneſſe, we ſee that the reading of the Scripture was permitted, yea, recommended and laudable in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and that neither by Chriſt Jeſus, nor his Apoſtles, nor the Romiſh Church in thoſe times, was it thought to be pernicious.</p>
               <p>None will ſay, that the Gentiles, Jewes, and Chriſtians of thoſe times were of greater judgement than thoſe of our times, or that they were more capable to read the holy Scriptures, and the moſt difficile Propheſies; for that ſhould be ridiculous.</p>
               <p>Neither dare any one ſay, that the Prophets and Apoſtles, and Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe, or the firſt Paſtours of thoſe times, had not as much and more underſtanding, than the Pope, or the Church of Rome in our time; and yet they did not conceive that ſome would abuſe ſuch reading; for that ſhould be a great impietie, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this muſt be the inference from ſuch a prohibition.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:156624:17"/>But to ſpeake truth, it appeareth to be no other thing, but a policy and malicious ſubtiltie of the Romiſh Church, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent too much corrupted, or rather from thoſe who governe the ſame, for feare that the people reading the holy Scriptures, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the errours and falſeneſſe of the doctrine therein preached, ſeeing ſo little conformitie in it with the Word of God.</p>
               <p>And truly, according to the Maxime of policy, and for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and upholding of their doctrine, they have as great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as <hi>Mahomet</hi> had to deſtroy all the Univerſities and Colledges of learning within the reach of his authoritie; for my part, I doe not remember to have ſeene any Chriſtians, who have not in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the holy Scriptures, faln ſoon to an infinite number of doubts, about the beliefe of the Romiſh Church; it being almoſt impoſſible to be otherwiſe: and as black is never better ſeen, than when it is brought neere to white in the light, ſo the lies and falſe doctrine being confronted and placed by the truth, cannot but appeare im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.</p>
               <p>And there are but few learned men, who perceive not this cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough; but being intereſſed in that party, and being bound to it with humane cords and bands, they ſtrive to diſſemble the ſame, that they may conſerve their goods and dignities, and by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of puſillanimitie or avarice, endeavour to ſuffocate and tread underfoot the prickings &amp; motions cauſed by the truth; but bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are they, whom neither wealth, nor honours, nor any worldly or humane conſideration, hinder to come to Chriſt, and who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his holy doctrine; and can ſay with S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 3.8.<note place="margin">Phil. 3.8.</note> 
                  <hi>I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count all things but loſſe for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt my Saviour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since then (courteous Reader) the reading of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is of ſuch vertue, that it diſcovereth the lies, and is ſo much recommended to us by God the Father, who hath ſpoken to us by his Prophets and ſervants, and by his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt, who hath preached it to us from his owne mouth, and by the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, who hath charged us therewith by his Apoſtles and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts; be in love with it, reade it againe and againe, without wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe. Let no power nor authoritie in the world, no prohibition of any whoſoever, hinder you from the reading of it; for it being againſt the will and intention of God, there is no power nor au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie in the earth can binde us from it.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, God who commandeth it, muſt rather be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:156624:18"/>
than all the Popes that forbid it, although they were uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Paſtours, as they falſely brag themſelves to be; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, it is a great ſin to neglect and ſet at naught the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of our God in that point, to obey man; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I exhort you againe to read the holy Scriptures couragiouſly and often, to have them continually before your eyes, to compare the whole doctrine of our ſalvation with them, and hold them for a ſure rule of all truth, to meditate and ruminate them unceſſantly, and obey the holy Spirit, who preacheth to us therein; for I doubt not but yee may reape great profit for your ſoules, neceſſary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction for your ſalvation, and a ſingular conſolation.</p>
               <p>And becauſe that ſome one (by Gods puniſhment and juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) abuſing the ſame, finds death inſtead of life, is that a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reaſon to deprive others thereof, &amp; forbid the reading of it? Becauſe the Sunne, the fire, or the water, occaſions ſometimes great damage to certain perſons, ought the uſe thereof be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to all men therefore as moſt dangerous? ſome there are who abuſe both the Sacraments and the bounty of God, yet no man will judge them ſo pernicious, and of ſo dangerous conſequence, that they ought to be abſtained from; and the Popes prohibition is grounded upon a too frivolous weak and ridiculous reaſon, to have any weight or authoritie in the judgements of the wiſer: Neither is there any who doe not ſufficiently ſee it to be meerly a humane and a politique invention, to conſerve a falſe doctrine and an uſurped juriſdiction, if he will but ſtrictly remarke it, as God hath given mee grace to doe.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of Traditions, and that they ought not to be taken for Iudge or Rule of our Faith.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Romiſh Church finding her ſelfe but weakly ſuſtained by the Scriptures, and not being able to maintaine her doctrine by the written Word of God, hath be thought of an unwritten word called Tradition, making it of the ſame power with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, and is therefore called Divine Tradition, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolique, and not humane; which ſeemed to me a brave field to lay open all her fancies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:156624:18"/>Now the rule and way of the Romiſh Church to know and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare thoſe Apoſtolique Traditions, is this; When the beginning and originall of any doctrine or Eccleſiaſticall ceremony is not knowne, neither exactly by whom, or in what yeare it was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, ſince the time of Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles, it is holden amongſt them of Divine and Apoſtolique Tradition. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, becauſe it is not certainly knowne, who was the firſt that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented holy-water, and imployed it in Baptiſme, and to other u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; it is eſteemed to come from Chriſt Jeſus and his Apoſtles, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it appeare ſufficiently from the holy Scripture, that Chriſt and his Apoſtles did never uſe that ceremony, but onely baptized with pure and naturall water.</p>
               <p>So becauſe it is not knowne who it was that firſt did pray to the Saints, that doctrine is ſaid to be of Apoſtolique and divine Tradition, and to come from Chriſt and his Apoſtles, although it appeare not in any place of Scripture, that ever any Apoſtle did pray to the Saints that were before them, or recommended it to us, but the contrary; and ſo of the reſt of their Traditions.</p>
               <p>Is not this a fine rule and prety invention? whereon to ground an infinite number of divine and Apoſtolique Traditions; for, Printing not being in uſe but within this two or three hundred yeares, there were but few things written before that, and that ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to be left to poſteritie; and that which was written, for the moſt part, dyed and vaniſhed by the death of the Author, or ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after, for not being tranſcribed: as it is with a great number of particular writings, eſpecially if they doe not concerne temporall things.</p>
               <p>So that in ſo many ages an infinite number of things, ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, doctrines, and errors, have been invented in the worſhip of God by the ſuperſtition, vanitie, and preſumption of ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular men, of which now it is impoſſible to know the originall and firſt Author; either becauſe it was never written by any, or if it hath been written, the writings have been loſt; if therefore all thoſe things muſt be eſteemed divine and Apoſtolique, out of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion there will be a numberles number of divine and Apoſtolique Traditions. And upon theſe conſiderations, I marveiled no more at the great number of Traditions, that are in the Romiſh Church; which I can aſſure you to be ſuch, that if they were all redacted to one volume, it would aſſuredly be greater than all the books of the Bible; for their number is almog infinite, and not certainly
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:156624:19"/>
known to this day, the number yet not being perfect; and hardly is there any generall Councells, in which ſome one or more new ones are not diſcovered.</p>
               <p>Thoſe of the Romiſh Church, who will not admit nor acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Scripture as Judge of faith, ſtrive nevertheleſſe to ſerve themſelves with it the beſt they can, to confirme their doctrine. But (I pray you) with what reaſon in the point of Traditions?</p>
               <p>To prove that the holy Scripture is not a ſufficient rule of faith, and that we muſt have recourſe to a word not written, which they call Tradition,<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 2.15.</note> they alledge this of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul, Wherefore my Brethren, be yee ſtedfast and hold faſt the Traditions which yee have learned ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by word or by our Epiſtle.</hi> Thence they inferre that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> had preached many things to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> which he had not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to them in his Letters, and therefore wee muſt beleeve more things than thoſe which are written.</p>
               <p>We ingeniouſly confeſſe, that the whole doctrine of ſalvation, and that which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> might have preached to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> is not in theſe two little Epiſtles; and affirme that we muſt beleeve more things than thoſe which are conteined in them; but thence it will not follow, that that which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> had preached to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> of the neceſſitie of faith and ſalvation, is not contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Old and New Teſtament; for there is great difference betwixt the two little Epiſtles to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> and all the reſt of the holy Scripture; and the conſequence is very bad, as every one may judge.</p>
               <p>Beſides, when S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Keep the Traditions,</hi> it will no more follow, that by this word <hi>Traditions,</hi> an unwritten word ought neceſſarily to be underſtood; and that beſides the written word of God, there is yet an unwritten word, equall in authoritie to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for, by the word <hi>Tradition,</hi> may be underſtood, that which is given and left either by word or writing, and not neceſſarily ſome word not written; for the holy Scripture is alſo a tradition, that is, a doctrine which hath been left us.</p>
               <p>And although wee ſhould grant that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> had preached to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> many things which are not written in the holy Scriptures, and exhorted them to keepe them, it will therefore not follow, that he did exhort them to keep all thoſe Traditions as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſalvation; for there are none who will not confeſſe that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> might have preached and ſaid many things which were not abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation, nor faith, but onely conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:156624:19"/>
and helpfull; as our Saviour did in his preaching; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our Saviour ſhould give us charge to remember them all, and keepe them, he doth not therefore meane that wee ſhould be equally obliged to keep them all, and that wee ſhould keep them otherwiſe, and in another faſhion, than he gave them to us, that is, the Articles of faith, as Articles of faith, and neceſſary to ſalvation; the Commandements as Commandements, the examples and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables, as ſuch things; eſſentiall to faith, as eſſentiall; the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and things accidentall as ſuch: and it is a very bad conſequence, drawne by the Romiſh Church, that becauſe S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> to keep the Traditions, he commandeth us all to beleeve and keep them, as pertaining to faith, and of equall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie with the Scripture; a word not written, and Traditions meerly humane, as divine Traditions, and chiefly all the Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Romiſh Church, which are almoſt without number.</p>
               <p>And mark that in all ages this hath been the malice of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, to have recourſe to Traditions, when the Scriptures faile them:<note place="margin">Tertull. de Monog. cap. <hi>2. Joh. 16.12.</hi> Bellarm. lib. <hi>5.</hi> de verbo Dei.</note> ſo <hi>Tertullian</hi> being become hereticall in his Booke <hi>de Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nogania, cap.</hi> 2. maintaineth the hereſie of <hi>Montanus,</hi> by thoſe words of our Saviour; <hi>I have yet many things to ſay unto you, but yee cannot beare them now.</hi> Which is the paſſage <hi>Bellarmine</hi> citeth for Traditions, <hi>cap.</hi> 5. of his Book of the unwritten Word; and yet it appeareth by the following verſe, that our Saviour by thoſe things which they cannot for the preſent beare, meant the things which are to come; as the propheſies concerning the things which were to fall out, which are to be ſeen in the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles, and in the <hi>Revelation</hi> of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>John,</hi> and ſuch like things, and not any doctrines of faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in the ſecond chap. of his third Book, ſaith,<note place="margin">Irenaeus cap. <hi>2.</hi> lib. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> that when any did convince the hereticks with Scripture, they began to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the Scripture; ſaying, that the truth could not be found in the Scripture, by thoſe who knew not the Tradition; becauſe it was not given in writing, but onely ſpoken verbally.</p>
               <p>Now this is practiſed by the Romiſh Church more than by any ſect that hath ever yet been, becauſe ſeeing Scripture doth faile her to maintaine her tyranny and innumerable ſuperſtitious policies, ſhe hath invented a word not written, which ſhee calleth Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, equalling their authoritie with the holy Scriptures; and thoſe Traditions are invented and augmented from time to time, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the will and fancy of the Popes; for ſome of them have
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:156624:20"/>
invented the Maſſe, and ſome other ceremonies; and one or other of them have now and then added to them, or taken from, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented or diminiſhed the ſame; ſome of them have invented Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, others Indulgences, ſome the invocation of Saints, others the reliques; ſome the Communion under one kinde, and yet to this day their number is not perfect, neither is it yet known to the Romiſh Church, that which our Saviour preached as neceſſary to faith and ſalvation; for as there were new Articles of faith made in the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> which was the laſt generall Councell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, (as that of juſtification and originall ſin;) ſo doe they hope to make yet more in the next Councell; as (it may be) of the conception of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> of predeſtination with or without merits, or ſome others.</p>
               <p>Here is another objection thoſe of the Romiſh Church thinke to be of great force, and which I my ſelfe have often uſed, diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt thoſe of the Romiſh Religion, pretending thereby to prove the neceſſitie of Traditions, and to referre our ſelves to the Church; for (ſay they) who gave you the holy Scripture but the Tradition? and whence know yee the Canonicall Books, from thoſe that are not Canonicall, but by the determination and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Church?</p>
               <p>It is true that every particular man receiveth the holy Scripture from the Church he liveth in, whether it be a pure or impure Church; ſo the Apoſtles had received from the Prieſts and Scribes, enemies of Jeſus Chriſt, the books of the old Teſtament; but in that the Church doth onely the office of a Witneſſe and not of a Judge, it onely witneſſeth that thoſe Books are holy and Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, but it judgeth not them to be holy, nor giveth them any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie; and the Tradition of the Church, witneſſing thoſe books to be divine and holy, is onely a proteſtation of her ſubjection to the Scripture, and not an uſurpation of her authoritie, above the written word of God. He who ſheweth the King to a ſtranger, is not therefore above the King, nor giveth he any authoritie to the King: and a Book-ſeller ſhewing to a buyer the Book of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of the Kingdome, doth not for that authoriſe thoſe Statutes: and ſome man may receive the holy Scriptures from the Church, and afterwards uſe it to condemne the ſame Church.</p>
               <p>And as the teſtimony of innumerable eyes and eares, ſeeing the lightnings, and hearing the thunder, maketh us ſay, that it thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth and lightneth; ſo the teſtimony of innumerable Churches,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:156624:20"/>
aſſuring us that the holy Scriptures are from God, cauſe us to give an aſſent to them as divine.</p>
               <p>Where it is to be noted, that as for the Books of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wee ought to take the teſtimony of the Churches under the New Teſtament; ſo for the Books of the old Teſtament, we ought to follow the judgement of the Churches of thoſe times, and refer our ſelves to their teſtimony, without making them for that Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the controverſie. Nor doth it appertaine to him who is to be judged by the holy Scripture, and the word of God, to make himſelfe Judge of that word of God; ſo it is a great impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to inferre from this objection, the neceſſitie of Traditions to be of the ſame vertue with the pure word of God.</p>

                  <p>Traditions condemned by the holy Scriptures.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>VVE have ſeen the teſtimonies of the holy Scripture, and the reaſons they of the Romiſh Church bring to eſtabliſh the doctrine of Traditions. Now let us ſee the teſtimonies of the ſame Scripture, which the Orthodox and reformed Church alledge to condemne thoſe Traditions, and conſider which of them are of greateſt ſtrength. As for mee having maturely conſidered the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, I cannot ſee how their force can be eluded, or rather that men yeeld not to their cleerneſſe.</p>

               <p>For my part, after I began to conſider attentively the words of the Apoſtle S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> on this ſubject, I could never ſee how thoſe of the Romiſh Church, can maintaine the doctrine of their Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as pertaining to faith, and equall in authoritie to the holy

                  <hi>Paul,</hi> and Chriſt Jeſus, and the other Apoſtles did preach; yea, even contrary; for all doctrine taught as neceſſary to faith out of the Scripture, is alſo contrary unto the Scripture, ſeeing it is againſt the prohibition, to adde to the Word of God;<note place="margin">Mat. 15.9.</note> and God condemneth them who teach for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of faith, the doctrine and commandements of men.</p>
               <p>And mark that Chriſt Jeſus in this chap. of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Matthew,</hi> did ſpecially condemne the Phariſees, becauſe they tranſgreſſed the commandements of God by their traditions: and what I pray you were thoſe traditions? they were not things expreſly forbidden in the law of God, but ſimple additions and willing devotions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the word of God, and which outwardly ſmelled of nothing but devotion, puritie, and holineſſe; as to faſt three times a week; to waſh the cups &amp; the platters, to tithe Mint and Anniſe, to make conſcience to heal any ſick man on the Sabbath day, to make long prayers, to abſtaine from certaine meats, and that not through a conceit that thoſe things were polluted, but through a willing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion and humilitie of ſpirit, or through a deſire to mortifie the fleſh; but becauſe thoſe things were taught as being of equall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie with the doctrine of faith, that is the cauſe wherefore they are condemned by the Son of God, as contrary to his holy Word.</p>
               <p>There is no doubt, but by this paſſage of the Apoſtle S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> we cited before, are alſo condemned all the Traditions of the Romiſh Church, which are taught and preached to be of equall authoritie with the holy Scriptures, which truely are beſides the Word of God, and the Goſpel that was preached by our Saviour and his Diſciples; for how cometh it to paſſe, that they ſhould have prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched ſo many things pertaining to faith and ſalvation? and never ſpeak any thing of them in any of their Books, nor in the acts of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:156624:21"/>
the Apoſtles, which is the Hiſtory of the moſt remarkable actions and Sermons of the Apoſtles, for more than twenty yeares; ſee if there be any thing ſpoken there of the invocation of Saints, of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgencies, Purgatory, prayer for the dead, of the Communion under one kinde, or of the reſt: and if thoſe and the like things be not in the holy Scriptures, they are beſides the Word of God, and conſequently, he that preacheth them is accurſed and Anathema, and they are not to be received as pertaining to faith.</p>
               <p>And to ſhew that the Traditions which the Church of Rome teacheth as Articles of faith, doe not come from Chriſt Jeſus, and his Apoſtles, nor cannot be ſaid to be Apoſtolique nor divine, but papall and humane, (to ſay no worſe) there is almoſt none of them the hiſtory of that Church ſheweth not by what Pope or Biſhop they were invented, and at what time they had their beginning:<note place="margin">Baro.

                  <p>That wee cannot ground our beliefe upon the Books of the ancient Fathers.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THoſe of the Romiſh Church to authoriſe their Traditions, which are beſides, nay contrary to the Word of God, ſend us to the Fathers, as to other Judges, to determine our differences, whoſe doctrine they affirme to be conformable to that which they teach.</p>

               <p>And to ſpeak truly, I finde that the Fathers of the firſt ages con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne in a number of places ſo manifeſtly the errors and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious doctrines of the Romiſh Church, that I have marvailed of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes, how they can have the boldneſſe to alledge them in their favour.

they being men, ſome things have now and then inſenſibly crept into the writings of ſome of them, which were not altogether ſo pure, and ſeeme ſomewhat to incline to ſuperſtitions, which by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little inſinuated themſelves into the Church.</p>
               <p>But I beleeve that though all their Books ſhould ſeeme mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly to contradict the faith of the Reformed Churches, wee are not obliged to receive them as our Judges, neither as irreprocha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Witneſſes; and howſoever I eſteeme highly of the Authours, yet wee cannot ground any Article of faith upon their Writings, but ſo far as wee finde them to conforme to the Word of God, which is the toucſtone of all truth, neither are wee bound to have recourſe to them any wayes.</p>
               <p>For if we were obliged to have recourſe to them, and receive them for Judges of our faith, that were to bring our faith and the point of our ſalvation in an impoſſibilitie (at leaſt morall) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all Chriſtians ſhould be obliged to have them, and to have them all, or the moſt part, (which is not poſſible, but to the richer ſort,) and having them they ſhould be obliged to reade them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all, and that wholy, to the end they might compare one with another, and ſee if they agree one with another in the ſame do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and if they be conformable to themſelves every where; and ſo none but thoſe who had great leaſure could reade them; and being almoſt all of them either in Latine, or Greeke, or other ſtrange tongue, &amp; but few of them in vulgar tongues, what ſhould they doe who underſtand neither Latine nor Greeke?</p>
               <p>There would be none then but the richer, and learneder, and thoſe who had no other imployment but to reade, could be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of their faith, and ſo all others ſhould be without faith and knowledge of thoſe things which concerne their ſalvation, and conſequently, in a manifeſt way of perdition by their ignorance. Notwithſtanding our Saviour his coming was to teach the poore as well as the rich, the ignorant as the learned, the Merchants and Tradeſmen as well as thoſe who are not ſo much imployed.</p>
               <p>Beſides, it is impoſſible to build upon their Writings, any beliefe of faith; for, as Printing was not in their time, but onely two or three hundred yeares ſince, thoſe who have written in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, even to our time, ſince our Saviour (which hath been thirteen or fourteen hundred yeares) have left us nothing but Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcripts, which behooved to be tranſcribed, that they might be diſperſed. Now there is no man who will not confeſſe, that the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:156624:23"/>
Originals and firſt Manuſcripts written or at leaſt reviſed and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the Fathers which compoſed them, have been ſeen but of a few, and little or nothing of them all is to be found at this time, nor was found when Printing did begin, they being either loſt or conſumed by fire, or time, or by the Wormes, or a multitude of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accidents, which we ſee doth eat and conſume the very ſtones and Iron.</p>
               <p>Now thoſe firſt Manuſcripts have been copied out by divers Writers, and that from hand to hand, from time to time, to be diſperſed and preſerved from age to age, and run over Kingdoms: and after a multitude of Tranſcriptions, paſſed (by example) ſince our Saviours time to us, how many faults, and what altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have been made in thoſe Books, and in the doctrine of thoſe Fathers? for there is no man almoſt how able ſoever, who can brag that he can tranſcribe a ſheet of paper, without committing ſome one or more faults: how many will there be then in a great Volume, as one of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Auguſtins,</hi> or S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

               <p>And as thoſe Clerks or Tranſcribers, who were called <hi>Amanu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſes,</hi> were for the moſt part mercenary, and did all for money, and profit, living by that trade; it is likely they took not much care, but thought onely upon a quick diſpatch, that they might gaine the more; and when they found any thing that ſeemed a fault to them, whether it was really ſo or not, they changed and corrected it according to their minde, and paſſion; it faring with faults as with balls of ſnow, which the more they are rolled, grow the bigger; ſo far was their faults to be leſned by their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, thav they were rather augmented and multiplied, the old con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing or rather growing worſe, and daily more new ones being made; ſo that ſome little time after, it might be ſaid of every Book, that it was (in a manner) no more the ſame Book, but altogether another, being ſo much changed and altered.</p>
               <p>And the Romiſh Church growing in power and authoritie, when ſhee found any thing in thoſe Books contrary to her do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and the increaſe of her greatneſſe, or againſt her deſignes and intentions, ſhee did condemne the ſame as falſified and falſly attributed to the Fathers, and correct it after her own minde and fancy; and when Printing was come in uſe, ſhee made choice of that which was moſt conformable to her doctrine, or rather moulding and forming it by her agents and ſupporters to her own minde, cauſed it ſo to be printed, ſuppreſſing and forbidding

other Copies, as ſpurious and corrupted (ſaid they) by ſome heretiques or malicious people, or falſly attributed to their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors; and ſo who can now ſay in the world certainly, that the writings fathered upon <hi>Irenaeus, Cyrillus, Auguſtin,</hi> and other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers, are the true and genuine Writings of thoſe Fathers, not falſified or ſuppoſed.</p>
               <p>And if it hath been ſo hard a matter to preſerve the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (which is but a little Book in compariſon of thoſe others) in its purity through ſo many ages, when Printing was not in uſe; What can we ſay of thoſe great Volumes which were not in ſo great requeſt, nor ſo much reſpected? and where the change and alteration was not of ſo great importance, to care ſo much, but where every one took often the authoritie to change, according to his fancy, and accommodate the Father to his minde, to authoriſe his beliefe.</p>
               <p>I think there is no man of good judgement in the world, who ſeeth not cleerly the force and power of this ſo manifeſt truth, and that it is impoſſible to ground any certaine beliefe (ſuch as that of faith ought to be) upon ſo uncertaine grounds. Beſides that, though they were moſt certaine, yet being men ſubject to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes and errours, wee were not obliged to make their opinions our Judges, if they be not conformable to the Word of God, which is the rule of all truth.</p>
               <p>For which cauſe I ſhall not ſtrive in this Booke to alledge many paſſages of Fathers, but onely ſhew my opinion, grounded upon ſtrong reaſons, and upon the vertue of the Scripture; My intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not being to make a great Volume, but onely a little Book, of ſmall coſt, and little time and paines, both for my ſelfe and the Reader.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Concerning the chiefe point of Controverſie, to wit, that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Peter</hi> had no primacy in the Church, and that the primacy of the Pope is an unlawfull uſurpation.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS I have ever beleeved, that the chiefe and moſt important point among all the controverſies betwixt the Catholique
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:156624:24"/>
reformed and the Romiſh Church, is that of the Primacy of the Pope, and whether he be Vicar of Chriſt Jeſus on earth, univerſall and generall Biſhop over all Chriſtians, and be head and ſuperiour of the Catholique Church. So it was the firſt motive of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and that which I eſteemed to have moſt need to be well conſidered and examined, as being the ground of all the Romiſh beliefe, which once over-turned, ſhee muſt of neceſſitie fall to the ground.</p>
               <p>And howſoever there be many other points of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, this nevertheleſſe is as the Center, where all the reſt do meet, and the axletree on which they all move, and the foundation that upholdeth them, becauſe that whatſoever point of faith or Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is in controverſie, thoſe of the Romiſh Church will have none but the Church for Judge, or (as I have ſhewed) the Pope, ſaying he is Vicar of Chriſt Jeſus, and head of the univerſall Church, and conſequently ſole Judge in matters of faith.</p>
               <p>And being the Pope of Rome pretendeth this authoritie, onely ſo far as he vaunteth himſelfe to be ſucceſſour of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter,</hi> to whom he ſaith that Chriſt Jeſus hath given this power. I have diligently examined the queſtion, to ſee what reaſon and ground the Doctors of the Romiſh Church have to maintaine the ſame; and howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, they reject the Scripture, and will not admit it to be Judge of controverſie; they are nevertheleſſe, neceſſitated to have recourſe to it, and receive it for Judge in this point; For the queſtion being of the Pope, he muſt not be Judge and party, and it would be an inſufferable impertinency to goe about to prove the Pope by the Pope, and maintaine that he is head of the Church, becauſe maintaineth he and affirmeth it; he muſt then of neceſſitie declare and produce his other titles, and ſhew by what vertue he poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this authoritie; there being no proſcription in matter of faith and conſcience; for otherwiſe the Religion of the Gentiles and Idolaters, would have been thought the beſt, and the doctrine of the Evangeliſts would never have been planted; for which cauſe alſo he laboureth to prove this his Article by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>And to that end we ſhall firſt ſet downe the ſtrongeſt of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, by way of objection; the weakneſſe and nullity of which, I ſhall ſhew: And although it be ſufficient enough for evidencing his power to be unlawfull, and uſurped, making it appeare that his titles are falſe, and of no force, and that wee are not obliged to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:156624:25"/>
bring proofes out of the Scriptures, for that which is not a point of our faith, it being ſufficient for us, that it is not in the Scripture which we hold for ſole rule and Judge.</p>
               <p>As for example, to prove that the <hi>Metamorphoſis</hi> of <hi>Ovid,</hi> is not an Article of faith, we are not bound to produce a formall and cleare paſſage, the <hi>Metamorphoſis</hi> of <hi>Ovid</hi> is not a point of faith; or the Fables of <hi>Eſop</hi> appertaine not to faith; but it is ſufficient that neither the one nor the other is to be found in Scripture; and ſo to ſhew that the primacy of the Pope, and of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> over the whole Church, and over all Chriſtians, is not a point of faith, it ſufficeth that it cannot be proved nor ſhewed out of the holy Scripture, and that all the paſſages they bring, are inſufficient to prove it.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe, we ſhall deale favourably with our Adverſaries in this point, and ſhew the negative out of the Scripture, and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate alſo from thence (by the grace of God) that our Saviour had never any intention to make S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> head of the Church, nor leave any Vicar nor ſucceſſour in his place; and that the Apoſtles did never beleeve nor thinke it, nor the ancient Primitive Church ever held the Pope of Rome for univerſall Biſhop &amp; generall head of the Church; and I perſwade my ſelfe, if one will compare with a judgement void of paſſion, the reaſons which prove this negative with thoſe the Romiſh Church bring to prove the affirmative, he will queſtionleſſe judge the firſt a great deale cleerer and ſtronger than thoſe of the Romiſh Church.</p>
               <p>It were a thing too tedious, both for the Reader and for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of my ſhortneſſe here to ſet downe all the paſſages of the holy Scripture they of the Romiſh Church produce to prove this; but, I take God to witneſſe, I ſhall produce all the ſtrongeſt reaſons they uſe, as I promiſe ſincerely and truely in all other points to doe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 16.17.</note>The firſt objection I ſhall produce is this, drawn out of <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.17. <hi>Jeſus came</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>into the coaſts of Ceſarea and Philippi, and asked his Diſciples, ſaying, whom doe men ſay that I the ſon of man am; and they ſaid, ſome ſay thou art John the Baptiſt ſome Elias, and others Jeremias, or one of the Prophets; he ſaith unto them, but whom ſay yee that I am, and Simon Peter anſwered, ſaying, thou art Christ the Son of the living God; and Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto him, Bleſſed art thou Simon Barjona; for fleſh and bloud hath not revealed this unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven; and I ſay unto thee, that thou

               </p>
               <p>We anſwer, ſecondly, that although we ſhould grant that our Saviour had founded his Church upon S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter,</hi> and that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> was the foundation of the Church, it would not follow thence that he was head and ſuperiour; for there is great difference betwixt the foundation and top of an houſe; betwixt the feet which are as the baſis and foundation of the body, and the head that is above

and governeth all the reſt; nor becauſe S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> was called the foundation of the Church, can any pretend therefore that he ſhould be the head and governour? for the Apoſtles and Prophets are alſo called the foundation of the Church, and of the Saints; <hi>Now therefore ye are no more ſtrangers and forrainers,</hi>

                  <hi>Peter</hi> and the Apoſtles being dead, the foundation of the Church behoved to have changed, and that much to the worſe, there never having been any equall to them ſince; and wee are not grounded upon another foundation than that whereon S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> was grounded; now he was not founded upon himſelfe but on Chriſt Jeſus, who not onely in his doctrine, but alſo in his proper perſon is the fundamentall and head-ſtone of the corner.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Objection of the Papiſts which I ſhall produce for proofe of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peters</hi> primacy, ſhall be drawne from the following words,<note place="margin">Mat. 16.14.</note> ſet downe in <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.14. <hi>And I will give thee the keyes of the Kingd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

In a word, they thinke all they are able to attempt, is lawfull to them, as being ſufficiently authoriſed by thoſe words, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing under the heavens is exempt from their juriſdiction, becauſe it is ſaid in that paſſage, <hi>Whatſoever thou ſhalt binde on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven.</hi> At the firſt ſight this paſſage wee have cited ſeemeth to be of great ſtrength, to maintaine the primacy of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:156624:26"/>
                  <hi>Peter,</hi> and his ſucceſſours, but I will onely turne over the leafe, to elude this objection, and ſhew its weakneſſe and inſufficiency for this purpoſe; for I finde in <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.18. that Chriſt ſaid to all his Diſciples and Apoſtles preſent, the ſame words in the plurall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>Verily, I ſay unto you, that whatſoever yee ſhall binde on earth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 18.18.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhall be bound in heaven, and whatſoever yee ſhall looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed in heaven. Quaecunque ligaveritis</hi> in the plurall number, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe, I have never as yet heard nor ſeen any Author that attributeth this generall and univerſall power over the whole Church, and over all Chriſtians, to any other of the Apoſtles, by thoſe words; why then to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Petrr</hi> more than the reſt? ſeeing the ſame words were ſpoken to them by Chriſt. This might be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Anſwer to the objection of the Romiſh Church.</p>
               <p>But becauſe they uſe theſe words yet further to give power to all their Prieſts to abſolve from all ſinnes, even the moſt ſecret, and to binde and looſe the ſoules and conſciences at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, I intreat you ſeriouſly to conſider the occaſion of this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, to ſee how little reaſon they have, or rather the great wrong they doe in eſtabliſhing a doctrine of ſo great importance on theſe words; for theſe are the words the Biſhops uſe at the conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Prieſts, impoſing their hands, and ſaying, <hi>Receive the holy Spirit, all that yee binde on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven, and all that yee looſe on earth ſhall be looſed in heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Jeſus preaching to his Diſciples of the order that ought to be kept in brotherly correction, ſaith <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.16.<note place="margin">Mat. 18.16.</note> 
                  <hi>If thy brother treſpaſſe againſt thee, goe and tell him his fault betwixt him and thee alone, if he ſhall heare thee, thou haſt gained thy brother; but if he will not heare thee, take with thee two or three more, that out of the mouth of two or three Witneſſes, every word ſhall be eſtabliſhed; and if he ſhall neglect to heare them, tell it unto the Church; but if he neglect to heare the Church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican; verily I ſay unto you, that whatſoever yee binde on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven, and whatſoever yee ſhall looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed in heaven.</hi> Thence every man may cleerly ſee that our Saviour ſpeaks of the exterior and publique ſinnes of our neighbour, which are knowne, not of ſecret ſinnes; and to keep the order of charitie and not diſhonour him, his will is, that when thou ſhalt know it, thou reprove him ſecretly between thee and him alone; but if he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſtill, take with thee two or three Witneſſes to reprove him in their preſence, and if for all that he continue in his ſin and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:156624:27"/>
accuſe him to the Congregation and company of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that he may receive correction; and if he doth not humble and ſubmit himſelfe, let him be excommunicate and thruſt out of the Congregation; and thereupon he aſſureth the Paſtours of his Church, in the perſon of his Diſciples, that whatſoever they ſhall binde or looſe on earth (being underſtood with this order of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie) ſhall be bound or looſed in heaven; that is, whomſoever they ſhall bind with the bands and ſentence of excommunication, ſhall be bound in heaven, and the ſentence ſhall be confirmed and ratified in heaven by God; and he whom they ſhall thruſt out of the Church and Congregation, ſhall be eſteemed of us as thruſt out in heaven.</p>
               <p>Is there any man in the world that can juſtly contradict the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall ſence of theſe words? and who ſeeth not that this hath been out of all doubt the true meaning of the Son of God? To what purpoſe then doe they apply that which was ſpoken of a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar caſe, and of exteriour and knowne ſinnes, to all the interiour hidden and ſecret ſinnes of the heart? and to what end doe they enlarge the power of the Miniſter (which is limited in this caſe) over all manner of perſons, ſubjects, and States? but the ambition to command maketh arrowes or rather Charcoale of all wood to defile it ſelfe and all its followers.</p>
               <p>See here another objection of the ſame mettle with the former. Our Saviour <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.15. ſaith to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> twice;<note place="margin">Joh. 21.15.</note> 
                  <hi>feed my Lambes,</hi> and once <hi>feed my ſheepe,</hi> and by conſequence, he hath eſtabliſhed him univerſall Paſtour over all Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>I marvell much that the Doctors of the Romiſh Church ſhould take pleaſure to forge ſuch bad conſequences; for I beleeve they know well enough, that <hi>Terminus indefinitus aequivalet particulari non univerſali,</hi> that an indefinite propoſition is equivalent to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and not to an univerſall or generall: Wee might ſay, that Chriſt in thoſe words did not recommend all his ſheep to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> nor give him power over them all; and let us grant notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> had charge to feed all the ſheep and lambs of the Lords flocke, and commiſſion to preach the Goſpell unto them, and feed them with the doctrine of life and ſalvation. The ſame Commiſſion and power was alſo given by Jeſus Chriſt to all the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Mark. i6.15. Mat. 28.19.</note> when he ſaid to them in <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.15. <hi>Goe yee to all the world, and Preach the Goſpell to every creature;</hi> and <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Goe and teach all Nations;</hi> for ſo ought the word <hi>feed</hi> to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:156624:27"/>
namely, to feed with doctrine and to teach; ſo it is not ſaid that primacy and ſuperioritie is attributed to them, but onely a Commiſſion and charge given to preach the Goſpel every where, and teach all men to beleeve.</p>
               <p>Further, I anſwer, that although this paſſage were underſtood of the power and authoritie (it being an indefinite propoſition) to wit, my ſheep, all the ſheep cannot be underſtood here, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe which Chriſt would eſpecially commit to his guard, and put under his government, to wit, the Churches which he was to found and governe.</p>
               <p>A King ſending a Nobleman to be Governour of a Province, or Citie, if perchance he ſay unto him, goe and governe my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects well; what foole is there in the world will beleeve, that by theſe words the King giveth him an ample &amp; unlimited power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all his Kingdome &amp; ſubjects, and createth him thereby his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour in all his eſtates after his death; would not he be thought to be hypocondriacally affected, who would make himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it? the King underſtandeth queſtionleſſe thereby his people and ſubjects which are in the Province and place where he is ſent as Governour, and not thoſe who are in other places.</p>
               <p>If a Biſhop ſend a Prieſt to governe a Pariſh or a Church, and ſay to him, goe I recommend my people and my ſheep unto you, teach them well, and inſtruct them faithfully, take great care to feed my flock with good doctrine; ought this Prieſt therefore to imagine with himſelfe, that all the people in his dioceſſe are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to him? and that the Biſhop giveth him ample power over all his Biſhopricke, and maketh him his ſucceſſour by thoſe words? Let him perſwade himſelfe as much as he can, as doe the <hi>Hypocon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driaques;</hi> but I beleeve he ſhould finde ſome to ſpeake withall, if he would undertake the exerciſe of ſuch authoritie without ſome other Commiſſion; for by that it is ſufficient he beleeves, that the Biſhop recommendeth to his charge the ſheep which he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his guard and leading.</p>
               <p>So it is without ſence and reaſon they imagine to inferre by thoſe words, that Chriſt hath given all power over the Church to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter,</hi> and eſtabliſhed him his Vicar and Succeſſour in his place, but onely he commandeth him to preach and declare the Goſpel every where, as he did in other places to all the other Apoſtles, without diſtinction of Jewes or Gentiles, Countreyes or Eſtates, but generally in every place where they ſhould be ſent. And after
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:156624:28"/>
this manner doth the Romiſh Church uſe the holy Scripture, to prove the Articles of their beliefe.</p>

To take the firſt fiſh he could catch, and take a piece of money out of its mouth, and pay the tribute for them two: therfore he made him his ſucceſſour after his death, and hath given him the Primacy over the whole Church, and over the other Apoſtles. See here the meaning of this hiſtory: ſome Collectour or Publicane cometh to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter,</hi> who was with our Saviour, as the firſt he found (it may be) or perhaps the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and conſiderable of all, and ſaid unto him, that their Maſter did pay no tribute to the Prince, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> telleth it to Chriſt, who commandeth him to go to the ſea, and the firſt fiſh he could catch, to take a piece of money which he ſhould find in his mouth, and pay for him and himſelf to the publicane, to eſchew ſcandalls: hereby it appeareth that he maketh him his ſucceſſour, and vicar after his death, and that he hath the Primacy and ſuperiority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the other Apoſtles and Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Is not this a conſequence handſomely deduced by wiſe men? and nevertheleſſe it is one of the Romiſh Church. The publicans and collectours (for the Prince) come to a noble man to ask of him ſome ſubſidy and tribute, they addreſſed themſelves to the firſt they met withall, or to ſome old ſervant, and tell him that his Maſter hath not paid the ſubſidies, the ſervant goeth and telleth it to his Maſter, who commandeth him to go to ſuch a place, and take money to pay for him, and himſelf; which he doth to ſhunne noiſe and ſcandall: this ſervitour ought he here for to preſume with himſelf, that he will ſucceed to all the goods and eſtate of his Maſter, and that thereby preheminence is given unto him over all his other companions, and fellow-ſervants, and ſhould he not ſhew himſelf altogether ridiculous, who would maintain the ſame to draw ſuch conſequences? and to found one Article of faith and the moſt important of them all, upon ſo frivolous conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures and weak proofs, is to make fools of men: there muſt be other proofs, and more authentique and clearer declarations, to pretend lawfully the greateſt power, and moſt advantagious ſucceſſion in the world.</p>

                  <hi>Peter</hi> (ſay they) was the firſt who was called to the Apoſtleſhip, therefore Chriſt made him his Succeſſour, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:156624:28"/>
Vicar; and gave him after his death the ſuperiority over his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and the whole Church.</p>
               <p>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>John</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Andrew</hi> having found Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1.41.</note> went and told his brother <hi>Simon,</hi> and brought him to Chriſt, ſo that by that means <hi>Andrew</hi> ſhould be the firſt of the Apoſtles, who found the Meſſiah, and knew Chriſt; but, put the caſe it were <hi>Peter,</hi> and that he was the firſt choſen of the Apoſtles, and called to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtleſhip; will it follow thence that Chriſt Jeſus made him his Succeſſour?</p>
               <p>The firſt ſouldier that is inrolled in a Company by his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, is he for that his Succeſſour after his death? muſt he have the ſuperiority after his Captains death over all the reſt, without other declaration or title at all? eſpecially the Captain having never declared any thing that way, but provided other waies for the government and leading of his company: there is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neither rhyme nor reaſon for deducing ſuch conſequences; ſo all this ſerveth onely to deceive the ſimple and weaker ſpirits; but every man of judgement, ſeeth well enough their weakneſſe, to believe or give credit thereto.</p>
               <p>Now I proteſt, they are the ſtrongeſt arguments the Romiſh Church produceth out of the holy Scripture, to prove the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter,</hi> and conſequently that of the Pope; for, there is nothing ſpoken of the Pope in the holy Scripture, nor doth he pretend any right thereto, but ſo farre as he termeth himſelf the Succeſſour of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter;</hi> and if they be attentively conſidered as they ought, I perſwade my ſelf there is no man in the world, provided he hath any ſparks of common reaſon, who will not judge them too ſmall and weak to prove ſo important a doctrine, which is the foundation of all the Romiſh belief, and this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly is more then ſufficient to ſhew that the power of the Pope is uſurped, that he hath not the authority he pretendeth over the Church, and that wrongfully he calleth himſelf the univerſall Paſtour over all Chriſtians, and Vicar of Jeſus Chriſt on earth, he not being able to ſhew or prove his ſucceſſion and power by any paſſage of Scripture, which hath any ſtrength or likelihood.</p>
               <p>But I minde not to ſtay there; (not for any obligation) but for greater ſatisfaction of thoſe who are deſirous of ſalvation and the truth, I will prove the negative by Scripture, and thereby ſhew that our Saviour had never intention to leave S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter,</hi> nor any other Succeſſour or Vicar in his place, and that the Apoſtles never

acknowledged S. <hi>Peter,</hi> nor any other for univerſall Paſtour, but Chriſt; we ſhall alſo ſee hereafter how the Pope of Rome was above three or foure hundred yeares without being acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for generall Biſhop, and univerſall Paſtour of the Church, which next we ſhall ſhew how this uſurpation was brought into the world, and how it hath been maintained in ſuch an ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous greatneſſe.</p>

               <p>ALthough it be ſufficient to prove the uſurpation of any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, that no authentique nor credible titles can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, ſo to prove the authority the Pope pretendeth over the Church to be uſurped, it is ſufficient that he cannot produce any paſſage of Scripture, which ſheweth with any appearance, that that authority was given him by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe, I ſhall ſhew the contrary out of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and evidence cleerely by the ſame, that it was never the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of Chriſt Jeſus, to leave S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> nor any other of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles as generall Vicar in his place, or ſuperiour over the whole Church, aſſuring the Reader, that if he will be but an indifferent Judge in this point, and examine this with ſinceritie and without paſſion, he ſhall finde my reaſons ſtronger for the negative which none is obliged to prove, than thoſe of the Romiſh Church for the affirmative of the moſt important article of their beliefe.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour (ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Luke</hi>) being neere the time of his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, did advertiſe his Diſciples of his death, telling them that the <hi>Son of man ſhould be delivered into the hands of men,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 9.49 Mark. 9.33.</note> 
                  <hi>and that they ſhould ſlay him, and put him to death, and that he would riſe againe the third day after his death. They underſtood not</hi> (ſay the Evangeliſts) <hi>theſe words,</hi> and that myſtery; nevertheleſſe, hearing him ſpeake of his death, they dreamed of a ſucceſſion and primacy after his death, and fell into diſpute among themſelves, who ſhould be the greateſt among them, and who ſhould command after his death.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:156624:29"/>
If Chriſt Jeſus had had any deſire to leave any Succeſſour after his death for univerſall head over them all, and the whole Church, that was a very fit occaſion to declare his will. None dare ſay, that he forgot himſelfe, for the Diſciples gave him ſufficient oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to thinke of it. Moreover, he being the eternall Wiſdome, he did remember all things he had to doe; neither was there ever in him defect of remembrance, or memory; S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> was preſent with the others, if he had a deſire to leave a Succeſſour, there is no man in the world who will not thinke that this was a faire oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to declare himſelfe there anent, his death being neere; or then take ſome other time to leave a ſucceſſour to them; and never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, he never ſpake ſo much as one word, neither at that time nor any other, onely he reproved and checked greatly their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition in that; and ſetting a little childe in the middeſt of them, exhorted them all to ſubmiſſion, and to the contempt of domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; to imitate the humble thoughts of that little childe, which were queſtionleſſe far from ambition.</p>
               <p>And obſerve that they did even diſpute of that primacy after our Saviour had ſaid to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter; Thou art Peter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 16.13.</note> 
                  <hi>and upon this rock, &amp;c.</hi> and the other words which the Romiſh Church bring for the primacy of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter;</hi> and if they underſtood thoſe words as the Romiſh Church ſaith they muſt be underſtood, how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it to paſſe, that they diſputed yet ſtill among themſelves for the primacy?<note place="margin">Luk. 22.26.</note> Was not that to oppoſe themſelves to the Lords command? And Chriſt ſaith not unto them, why diſpute yee for the primacy? doe yee not well remember, that I have already gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the ſuperioritie to <hi>Peter?</hi> if it was given (as they pretend) this was the anſwer he behoved to make, but he exhorteth them onely to humilitie, and to the contempt of all primacy. And as they diſputed yet another time the night before his death, he ſaid to them, <hi>The Kings of the Nations exerciſe Lordſhip over them, but it ſhall not be ſo amongst you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now ſeeing Chriſt hath not left a Succeſſour, neither at that time, nor at any other, it is an evedent ſigne, that he would not, that it was never his intention, and that it is to conjecture with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon to thinke the contrary.</p>
               <p>Further, our Saviour being neere to his death, yea a few houres before he was taken, he deſired (being with all his Diſciples toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) to ſup with them, and celebrate the Paſſeover;<note place="margin">Ioh. 14.4.</note> after Supper he riſeth from the Table, and laying aſide his garment, girdeth
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:156624:30"/>
himſelfe with a linnen cloath, putteth water into the Baſon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and waſheth the feet of his Apoſtles, beginning (it is true) at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> (it may be) as one of the ancienteſt, and being of a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit and a bold, he was queſtionleſſe one of the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable amongſt them: nor muſt we marvell, if our Saviour ſpoke often to him, and that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh ſometimes for all the reſt, not by office nor dignitie, but (poſſibly) through confidence of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitie in diſcourſing; (but this by the way) he doth the ſame to the other Apoſtles, and waſheth their feet; he reſumeth his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſitteth down to the Table againe, and beginneth a long exhortation to them, as being the laſt of all, both to bid them fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, and declare to them his laſt Will. It is (out of all doubt) at this time that he ſhould ſpeak to them of a Succeſſour, if he have any intention to leave one after him; he exhorteth them by his owne example to humilitie, to puritie and patience, to charitie and to love one another; he ſpeaketh to them of his deitie, and of eternall life, of the perſecutions and tortures which he and they were to ſuffer. In a word, he telleth them a number of things, which may be ſeen at large in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> chap. 13. but he ſpeaketh not one word to them of a Succeſſour,<note place="margin">Ioh. 13.</note> nor of leaving a Vicar in his place, or an univerſall head after his death. And is it not a moſt evident ſigne, if he have not done it, that he would not doe it? for that was his laſt exhortation before his death, knowing that they ſhould not conveene, nor he ſee them any more together, to ſpeake to them.</p>
               <p>He ſpeaketh indeed of <hi>Peter</hi> and to him when he ſpoke of his inconſtancy, that he ſhould deny him three times; but he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth never a word to him of primacy, or leaving him as his Vicar on earth; he ſaith often that he is to depart from them, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth he will not leave them Orphans, but that he will ſend them the holy Spirit to abide eternally with them, to comfort them and teach them in all truth; but he ſaith not to them, that he will leave them another Maſter in his place, a generall Vicar or head and ſuperiour, whom they muſt obey after him.</p>
               <p>There are none who will not judge, that if he had intention to doe it, it ſhould eſpecially have been at this time an occaſion, and if he hath not done it here, nor elſewhere, it is an infallible and certaine proofe, that he will leave no other ſuperiour over the Church but himſelfe and the holy Spirit;<note place="margin">Mat. 28.20.</note> and he ſaith that he would remaine and ſtay with them alwayes, even to the end of the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:156624:30"/>Beſides, our Saviour being upon the Croſſe, recommendeth his Mother to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>John,</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>John</hi> to his Mother; if S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould have been his Succeſſour and Vicar after his death, he might even then have ſpoken ſomething, but neither did he it there, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, nor after he was riſen, although he was converſant amongſt them, and with his Diſciples oftentimes, for the ſpace of fortie dayes; is not this then a moſt manifeſt and cleere proofe, that he would leave neither Succeſſour nor generall Vicar in his roome? and that it is without ſence or reaſon to ſay he left S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter.</hi> If the teſtimony of all the men in the world ſhould be found to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict this ſame, would it be of greater force and ſtrength than this? The Word of God ought to triumph over all; neither ſhould any thing be oppoſed to it, and it is blaſphemy to attempt it: there needeth no gloſſes here, for this is cleere enough; but either muſt a man renounce all that is in the holy Scripture, or acknowledge this doctrine and truth; nor could ever I conclude otherwiſe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving conſidered it.</p>
               <p>Here you may ſee (good Reader) by the holy Scripture, that Jeſus Chriſt had never intention to leave any man for Succeſſour and univerſall Vicar or generall head in his place; and that he himſelf alone would be governour and director for ever, and none other but himſelfe. Therefore it is wrongfully that the Pope of Rome groundeth and maintaineth his authoritie upon that. Now let us ſee by the holy Scripture, that the Apoſtles did never hold <hi>Peter</hi> for his Succeſſour or univerſall head of the Church.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Proved by the holy Spirit, that the Apoſtles did never acknowledge <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Peter</hi> for ſuperiour, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall head of the Church.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IF S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> hath been inſtituted by Chriſt generall Paſtour of the Church, and Superiour over all the Apoſtles, and Chriſtians, I undoubtedly beleeve that the other Apoſtles did know it perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for although Chriſt ſhould never have declared any thing to them, yet the holy Spirit, who inſtructed them in all truth, would have taught them this ſo important a point. So it is that it may be proved, even by the Scripture it ſelfe, that the Apoſtles did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:156624:31"/>
acknowledge this ſuperioritie and primacy in <hi>Peter;</hi> and therefore we may ſafely conclude, that he never had it.</p>
               <p>I finde in the Acts of the Apoſtles, chap. 15.7. that the firſt Councell of the Church after the death of our Saviour, was holden at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>James</hi> was Biſhop and not S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter,</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> and others came expreſly, that the Apoſtles and Elders did aſſemble to confer about ſomething touching Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, and after great debate, <hi>Peter</hi> (ſaith <hi>Luke</hi>) roſe up and ſpake, and after him <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> declaring what ſignes and wonders God had done by them among the Gentiles; and ſo ſoone as they had done, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>James</hi> anſwered, ſaying, <hi>Men and brethren, hearken unto mee; Simon hath declared how God, &amp;c. Wherefore my ſentence is, that wee trouble not them, which among the Gentiles are turned to God, but that we write unto them, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now judge (I pray you) by this paſſage, if <hi>Peter</hi> may be thought chiefe in this ſo noble and famous action; if there be any of the Apoſtles, who may be thought ſuperiour in this aſſembly, it is queſtionleſſe S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>James,</hi> the Councell holding in his Citie and Church. It is true, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh after ſome diſpute, not firſt (as is pretended) for they had already diſputed and ſpoken, but S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>James</hi> pronounceth ſentence in this aſſembly, and as Judge, and of moſt authoritie in the Councell (it being done in his Church) he impoſeth ſilence to ſpeak and pronounce the ſentence, as is the cuſtome of the Judges, and ſaith, <hi>Wherefore my ſentence is,</hi> or now I Judge, <hi>Ego autem Judico,</hi> as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Jeroms</hi> tranſlation hath it: which que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſſe he did, not as ſuperiour to all, but as Biſhop of the place where the aſſembly was holden, and to whom for that reſpect, the firſt place and greateſt authoritie was due; as there is no Biſhop in the world, that giveth not place to another in his owne Church, and within the bounds of his Juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>But if <hi>Peter</hi> had had the primacy, he would have pronounced the ſentence as Judge and as Maſter and ſuperiour over them all, and it was his to ſay, <hi>Ego Judico:</hi> I marvell alſo that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>James</hi> ſpeaking to him (if he thought him Vicar of Chriſt) ſaid not our Maſter <hi>Simon,</hi> or the univerſall Vicar and Paſtour, or gave him not ſome great title, ſuch as is now given to the Pope, it being a great over-ſight to omit it; but he ſaith onely, <hi>Simon hath told;</hi> if <hi>Simon</hi> was his ſuperiour and univerſall head of the Church, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>James</hi> was greatly to be blamed in this point, for ſome irreverence or little reſpect; but knowing that there was but equalitie among

them, he uſeth him as his equall, keeping onely the authoritie and dignitie of his own Sea.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid in the Acts, chap. 11.1. that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> having converted and baptized <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Centurion, and all thoſe men who were Gentiles, he came up againe to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and being there they who were of the Circumciſion, (that is, the converted <hi>Jewes</hi>) would have reproved him, and contended with him, ſaying, <hi>Why wenteſt thou into men uncircumciſed, and didst eat with them; Peter</hi> beginneth and declareth all the matter unto them in order, and juſtifieth the action; if S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> was head of the Church, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Paſtour of all Chriſtians, and of all the world, I marvell firſt how they had the boldneſſe to reprove him for preaching to the Gentiles, whoſe Paſtour he was as well as of the Jewes; and I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire alſo that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> ſeemeth to excuſe himſelfe before them upon a particular revelation and commiſſion, and did not rather tell them, that being univerſall Paſtour, he had power over all ſoules, and it belonged to him to preach the Goſpell to every creature, not onely to the Jewes but alſo to the Gentiles: certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he did not acknowledge as yet that generall power and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall primacy in himſelfe, nor yet did Chriſtians acknowledge it in him; for out of all queſtion they would have ſpoken otherwiſe to him, and he would alſo have anſwered in other tearmes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if he had thought to have had that infallibilitie which the Pope of Rome vindicateth to himſelfe; which he ſaith he hath gotten by the ſucceſſion, and in the perſon of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, the Apoſtles ſent <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> to preach in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria;</hi> would the Pope now adayes receive any ſuch commiſſion,<note place="margin">Acts 8.</note> and goe preach to the <hi>Indians,</hi> or in <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> by Commiſſion from ſome other Biſhops in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Italy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.16.</note> that the preaching of the Goſpel of the Uncircumciſion was committed to him, as that of the Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

               <p>Here (if you pleaſe) you may obſerve that he attributeth no more to <hi>Peter,</hi> than to <hi>John</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> but calleth them all three, Pillars, and nameth not <hi>Peter</hi> but <hi>James</hi> firſt; which ſhewed that he acknowledged no ſuperioritie amongſt them above the reſt;

and ſaith further, that the right hand of aſſociation was given him (that is, they received him for companion) to goe and preach to the Gentiles as they to the Jewes. Is there any Biſhop in the world who dare write himſelfe companion to the Pope? and the charge to preach to the Gentiles, was it not the moſt honourable and greateſt and moſt fit to the univerſall Paſtour of the world? which if S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> had been, it was to him rather than to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Here you ſee how <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith that he withſtood <hi>Peter</hi> to his face; becauſe he was to be blamed; yea and reproved him ſharply for his diſſimulation and evill example; if <hi>Paul</hi> had acknowledged <hi>Peter</hi> for his ſuperiour and head over all Chriſtians, it is out of all doubt a great fault in <hi>Paul</hi> to reſiſt his ſuperiour to his face, and ſo to write; and if he did acknowledge in him that infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie whereof the Pope braggeth, how ſaith he, that he was to be blamed and faulty? there can be no other thing anſwered to this, but that <hi>Paul</hi> did not acknowledge any ſuperioritie or infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in Saint <hi>Peter;</hi> otherwiſe there is none of good judgement in the world, who would not think <hi>Paul</hi> guilty of a fault and crime of contempt: and yet no man, even to this day, nor any Pope durſt ever condemne this fault in <hi>Paul;</hi> and did alſo he onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge <hi>Peter</hi> as his equall and fellow-Apoſtle, whom he was bold to reprove, and I beleeve that every man who is not inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed, and is void of paſſion, will judge with me by thoſe paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Scripture, and with the orthodox belief, that the Apoſtles did never acknowledge this ſuperiority and Primacy in <hi>Peter,</hi> and that it is in vain to the Pope to vindicate the ſame to himſelf,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:156624:32"/>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> having never had it.</p>
               <p>Finally, if Saint <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf did think he had this univerſall authority over all the Apoſtles, and all Chriſtians, and all the Churches of the world, I marvell he never made it appear, nor uſed it at any time, and that there is nothing ſpoken of it in the Acts of the Apoſtles, which are the hiſtory of the Apoſtles for more then 20 years; I marvell alſo that he did not addreſſe ſome Epiſtles to all the Chriſtians in the world, but contented himſelf to write onely to ſome Jewes who were diſperſed by the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saint <hi>Steven;</hi> and I marvell yet moſt of all, he did not put ſome titles before his Epiſtles, to make known his Primacy; he doth not write <hi>Peter</hi> Biſhop of Biſhops, or univerſall Paſtour of the Church, or great Vicar of Chriſt on earth,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1.</note> nor any ſuch thing, but onely <hi>Peter an Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt, to the ſtrangers which are ſcattered in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Aſia and Bythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia:</hi> there is not ſo much as one word in both thoſe Epiſtles that favoureth of his Supremacy, his words are not the words of a Maſter, nor of a Superiour or Soveraign: doth a Soveraign ever write long letters to his ſubjects? and never ſpeak to them as a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, how humble ſoever he be without uſing any word of Lord and Maſter, or giving any commandement.</p>
               <p>It appeareth then hereby, and by that which we ſpoke before, that the Apoſtles did never acknowledge this Primacy of Saint <hi>Peter;</hi> nor did he ever acknowledge it himſelf: and I beleeve, I have ſufficiently proved this by Scripture, to be judged by any man of judgement that thoſe arguments of Scripture to prove this negative, (to wit that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> had no Primacy) are beyond all compariſon ſtronger than thoſe which the Romiſh Church doth produce to prove the affirmative of this Doctrine, (to wit, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was Head of the Church.)</p>
               <p>I know that the Doctours of the Romiſh Church want not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications in their favour upon thoſe paſſages, whether found out by them, or ſome of the auncients; for there is no errour that may not finde ſome colourable pretext; but we ſhall give ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent anſwers thereto in the next chapter, and J proteſt I never found ſatisfaction, nor I beleeve ſhall any man of ſound judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment find ſatisfaction therein; for this truth is too clear and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to be contradicted.</p>
               <p>Now let us ſee if the Biſhop of Rome, who calleth himſelf Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> was acknowledged by the primitive

               <argument>
                  <p>That although Saint <hi>Peter</hi> had had the preeminence, the Pope hath no right to challenge it to himſelf, and that the Primitive Church never acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged this univerſall Superiority in the Biſhop of Rome.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe firſt queſtion to be cleared here, ſhould be whether Saint <hi>Peter</hi> were ever Biſhop of Rome, or if he ever was at Rome; for the Pope of Rome pretendeth onely his Primacy by ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in the Sea of Rome, to which, ſaith he, is annexed the generall chair and univerſall power over all chriſtians.</p>
               <p>If any truth may be drawn from the Scripture in this point, it is out of all doubt more probable, yea and more certain, that he was never Biſhop, nay that he was never there, then otherwiſe: for it was a ſtrange and hard thing to beleeve, that he was there and founded that Church, eſtabliſhed there his Sea and chair, which the Pope eſteemeth the firſt in the world, it being not ſo much as once mentioned in the holy Scripture, as well as that of <hi>Antioch,</hi> where <hi>Peter</hi> is ſaid to have been, nor did <hi>Paul</hi> being a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Rome ever ſpeak of <hi>Peter,</hi> who ſhould have been there at the ſame time he was: and often recommending the faithfull, ſaith nothing of the chief amongſt them, (to wit <hi>Peter:</hi>) Moreover writing from <hi>Corinth</hi> to the Romans, whom he had taught, he ſaluteth a multitude of Saints and chriſtians at Rome, naming them particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, but greeteth not Saint <hi>Peter</hi> at all, who ſhould have been Superiour and Maſter to <hi>Paul</hi> and all the faithfull: ſo from the reading and conſideration of the holy Scripture, a ſtrong proof may be drawn to prove, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was never Biſhop of Rome, nor ever was at Rome.</p>
               <p>But I think not the queſtion of ſo great importance, as to detain longer the eyes and minds of the Reader thereupon; for though we grant that he was both at <hi>Rome,</hi> and was Biſhop at <hi>Rome;</hi> it can give no ſuperiority to the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> (Saint <hi>Peter</hi> having never had it as you have ſufficiently heard) and although he had
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:156624:33"/>
had, it is not an infallible conſequence to make an article of faith that the Biſhop or Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould have it alſo.</p>
               <p>Moſes was eſtabliſhed by God in the office of Prieſt, Lawgiver and Prince in Iſrael, but he left no Succeſſour in that office and dignitie, for God did not command it: Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt alſo had no Succeſſour in his office; nor the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in their Apoſtleſhip: although then we ſhould grant that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was generall Paſtour and Head of the Church, why ſhould we give him a Succeſſour in that chardge, ſeeing God hath given no ſuch command in his word.</p>
               <p>And when Saint Peter writeth to the Chriſtians, he doth not command them to acknowledge the Biſhop of Rome for his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour after his death: was there ever any Kingdome or Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, temporall or ſpirituall in the world, eſtabliſhed without there were ſome Laws, made about the Succeſſion or form of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? here appeareth no ſuch thing, nor any declaration of the will of God upon this ſubject: wherefore then doth the Pope claim this without the word of God, and make it an article of faith.</p>
               <p>Further if <hi>Peter</hi> was eſtabliſhed univerſall Head of the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church, it was then when the Church was ſmall, and the chardge was eaſie, but it being now grown great, and chriſtians ſpread over all the world, what ſhoulders are ſtrong enough to ſupport ſuch a burthen?</p>
               <p>Now if after the death of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> there behoved a Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour and Head of the univerſall Church to be choſen, let all men who have but the leaſt ſpark of judgement, judge if that office ought not to appertain either to <hi>James</hi> or <hi>John,</hi> whom <hi>Paul</hi> to the Galathians calleth the pillars of the Church, who lived a long time after Saint <hi>Peter</hi> or to ſome other of the Apoſtles, rather then to deferre it to <hi>Linus</hi> Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> diſciple, of whom nothing is extant but his name, or to <hi>Clement,</hi> of whom they produce onely ſome writings, which becauſe they contain too ridiculous things to be beleeved, are rejected as Apocrypha; or to <hi>Cletus</hi> or <hi>Anacletus,</hi> for it is uncertain to which of thoſe thice.</p>
               <p>Or at leaſt they ought to have honoured thoſe excellent Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, ſo farre as to call them and ask their advice, for the chooſing an Head of the Catholick Church: who will beleeve that even in the time of the Apoſtles, a ſmall number of chriſtians at Rome, ſome of them converted Jews, ſome Gentiles, ſhould have had the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:156624:34"/>
credit to give a Head and Pope to the Catholick Church, meerly of their own authority, without communicating with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles? or other Chriſtians of <hi>Epheſus, Corinth, Jeruſalem, Aſia,</hi> and the reſt, who were beyond compariſon in greater number, and more conſiderable than themſelves? being converted before them and auncienter Chriſtians; many of them having ſeen and heard the Sonne of God preach, and been his Diſciples.</p>
               <p>Where is that word of God which giveth this power to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Rome,</hi> (which beſides the perſon of the Emperour, who at that time did live there ruling in all cruelty and wickedneſſe, had nothing more conſiderable than thoſe of other Cities,) to give a chief Prieſt, a Prelate and a Superiour to all the Apoſtles then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and to all the Biſhops, whereof many were Diſciples of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, and to all Chriſtians diſperſed in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny provinces and kingdomes? he muſt be very blinde who will perſwade himſelf of ſuch a thing without the word of God, or ſome other authentique priviledge for it out of the Goſpel, the Acts of the Apoſtles, their Epiſtles, or ſome other books wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of belief.</p>
               <p>But if <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Rome</hi> and was Biſhop, (which is not likely) he that ſucceeded him might ſucceed in the office and dignitie of Biſhop, but not in that of Apoſtle, which was perſonall, neither in the charge of univerſall Biſhop and Head of the Church, which <hi>Peter</hi> never had.</p>
               <p>Nor do we find the firſt three or foure hundred years and more after the death of our Saviour, that any Biſhop or other writer did ever give to the Biſhop of Rome the title of univerſall Biſhop, of generall head and Superiour, or any ſuch thing, nor that ever any of the Romiſh Biſhops durſt lay claim to it.</p>
               <p>We find indeed that many Biſhops from diverſe places did write to them concerning ſundry points of Religion, not as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the determination to them, but to ask their advice, not as from Judges, but as from Doctours and fellow-Biſhops, who having their chair in the chief Citie of the world, might juſtly be eſteemed men of capacitie and merit: ſo we ſee they are content in their Epiſtles to call them fellow-Biſhops, or brethren and companions; never Superiors, nor Maſters, nor univerſall Biſhops or Paſtours, or any ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>It would be too tedious to ſet down all the Epiſtles which bear theſe titles, and although I ſhould cite them, yet would ſome men
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:156624:34"/>
affirm, I had left out thoſe in which the title of univerſall head is found.</p>
               <p>But for an irreprehenſible proof of this before any reaſonable man, let them but read the lives of the Popes written by Popiſh authours, eſpecially by one <hi>Du Cheſne,</hi> a modern writer, who doth not forget nor omit any thing to prove the Primacy and power of the Popes of Rome; there yee may ſee in the life of every Pope, the name and ſubject of all thoſe who write to him, and whereof any knowledge could be had; and this man thinketh to draw great advantage for the Primacy of the Biſhop of Rome, from the multitude of letters written to him from ſo many places, which was onely done for the reaſon alleadged before: but not ſo much as one word is there to be ſeen of Superiour or univerſall head of the Church, or any ſuch like thing, but onely of fellow-Biſhop, brother, companion, coequall, or ſome ſuch thing, which ſhewed no Superiority or Primacy, but onely equality: as for the word Pope, which is as to ſay Father, or (if ye will) Father of fathers, <hi>Pater patrum;</hi> it was a name common in ancient time to all Biſhops: and when they called him Biſhop, that was neither univerſall, nor yet of Rome nor Romane (but very ſeldome) but onely Biſhop of the Citie of Rome; to ſhew, that in thoſe times his Juriſdiction extended not without the walls and ſuburbs of the Citie of Rome. Whence it may be obſerved, that in much probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, the Biſhops yet of thoſe times were no more than the Paſtours of pariſhes, as it is certain they were at the firſt inſtitution, there being not yet at that time ſpeech of dioceſſe, nor of Paſtour that had authoritie over many Paſtours or Churches; and the number of Chriſtians being but ſmall every where, one Paſtour did ſerve and was ſufficient for the greateſt Cities, who was called Biſhop, uſing the aid and aſſiſtance in his charge of the Presbyters, (that is to ſay) Elders; and out of the number of the Elders was ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily choſen the Biſhop, which is to ſay, Intendent or overſeer of the flock, (but this by the way.)</p>
               <p>Now to return to the Biſhop of Rome: it is true, that ſome times they were tranſported with flattery, or by way of civility and complement to give him ſome titles and Epithites of praiſe, ſavouring more of flattery than truth, extolling either his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or holineſſe beyond all chriſtian modeſty and appearance of truth: but by a ſpeciall providence of God, who would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this pure doctrine for his elect, or becauſe that was too great
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:156624:35"/>
a prejudice for them, they were never induced to give him any title, which might any way ſhew that Primacie or generall ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority, and that without any contradiction of the whole Romiſh Church, to the time of <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> which is about 300. yeers, and a long time alſo after him.</p>
               <p>Which if the Biſhop of Rome had had, or thought to have had, it was highly to wrong him in writing to him, and not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him thoſe titles of honour which were due unto him: Nor was it a good way to obtain ſatisfaction in that which they ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to refuſe him thoſe qualities of ſuperioritie his ſubjects did owe him, eſpecially in ſo teetling and important a thing. Is there any Prince in the world, that would not have reaſon to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, if one of his vaſſals writing to him ſhould call him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade and companion, writing nothing in his letter to ſhew his ſubmiſſion, and the dependence he hath on his Lord; and yet in thoſe firſt ages, we read not of any Pope that was offended with any Biſhops who writ to them, for calling them brother, fellow Biſhop, or companion, or for denying him the title of Univerſall Head.</p>
               <p>This therefore is a manifeſt proofe that no Biſhops did beleeve the Pope of Rome to be univerſall head of the Church, and that the Biſhops of Rome did not think it of themſelves: if this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence be not reaſonable, I know not what may be thought rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable in the world; Judge thou indifferent Reader, with a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of ſinceritie, and void of paſſion.</p>
               <p>They of the Romiſh Church, it may be, will produce againſt all that we have cleerly alledged and proved from the Scriptures or otherwiſe, a number of paſſages, out of ſome Fathers, men of the firſt ages (for ſince <hi>Sylveſter</hi> that the greatneſſe of the Biſhop of Rome did begin, we muſt not marvell for the reaſons alledged) which ſeem to give the Primacy to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Biſhop of Rome; but the anſwer is brief in this and other points; if they produce ten ſeeming teſtimonies for them, I ſhall produce a dozen to the contrary, taken out of the ſame Fathers, a great deale ſtronger, cleerer, and of greater force than others.</p>
               <p>But not to ſtay any longer upon their needleſſe things; let them ſhew us the true manuſcripts, written by thoſe ancient Fathers, and we will take the pains to read them, and examine their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; although nothing ought to be oppoſed to the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:156624:35"/>But to alledge us books written eight or nine hundred yeers after the Autographs, and written or printed after a thouſand copies, and under the higheſt power of the Church of Rome, there is no reaſon we ſhould trouble our brains with them, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo thoſe books, being laid together, can in nothing equall nor come neer the authoritie of the holy Scriptures, which are avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and acknowledged of all men, and ſpeak moſt cleerly and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly in this point.</p>
               <p>And ſo for the Fathers in this and other matters, becauſe I will ſay no other thing than that which I have ſaid in the ſeventh Chapter of this book, I intreat the Reader to ſee it there.</p>
               <p>But how cometh it to paſſe, that the Pope of Rome hath poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed himſelf of ſo great an authority, and maintaineth the ſame in ſo high a degree for ſo many ages.</p>

                  <p>In what manner and at what time the Biſhop of Rome uſurped the Primacie.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THoſe who will read and conſider attentively the Hiſtory of the Chriſtian Church, eſpecially the life and hiſtory of the Popes, written by Popiſh Authors themſelves, will cleerly ſee that the firſt 300. yeers after the death of our Saviour, to the time of Pope <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> the Biſhop of Rome did pretend no authoritie over the Biſhops, nor did any give him the title of Univerſall Head and Biſhop in any of the Epiſtles, which were written unto him: the Biſhop and Church of Rome afflicted with the perſecutions and tyrannies of the Emperours, imploying their thoughts rather for the conſervation of the faith, in the practiſe of humility and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, than in ambition and uſurpation of any authoritie which belongeth no wayes unto them.</p>
               <p>But as honours change manners, and ſeldome to the better, <hi>Constantine</hi> the Emperour having been baptized by <hi>Sylvester</hi> then Biſhop of Rome, and made the firſt Chriſtian Emperour by an exceſſive zeal of devotion (to the great prejudice ſince of all Chriſtendome) transferred his Court to Conſtantinople, leaving the City of Rome to <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> with a donation of many Lands, Lordſhips, and rents; ſo by that gift the Biſhop of Rome became
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:156624:36"/>
the richeſt and greateſt Lord and moſt conſiderable, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of all the Biſhops of the Chriſtian Church; it being knowne through the world, that the ſole Emperour and Monarch of the world, had left him his imperiall Citie, and inriched and gratified him with ſo great wealth and honour for him and his ſucceſſors the Biſhops of Rome; and howſoever this good Biſhop did ſee himſelfe poſſeſſed of all this wealth, yet did he never uſurpe any primacy nor title of head and ſuperiour over other Biſhops or Chriſtians himſelfe, nor his ſucceſſours for two hundred yeares after his death.</p>
               <p>It is true, that being made the richeſt, potenteſt, and moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable amongſt all the Biſhops, many began to honour him more, and write to him with greater reſpect (which ever followeth ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and greatneſſe) and being thus eminent among all Chriſtians, if there were any Biſhop who was perſecuted by other Biſhops, or excommunicated by his Patriarch or Metropolitan, or by any Councell, either juſtly or unjuſtly, he went preſently to Rome, addreſſing himſelfe to the Biſhop, as the richeſt of them all, to aſſiſt him, and the moſt powerfull and of greateſt authoritie, to protect him againſt his adverſaries: and as neceſſitie and extremitie paſſe often all the limits of truth, many amongſt them to captivate his good will and favour, ſtrove to give him as great titles as their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry could ſuggeſt; and although they who gave them, and they to whom they were given, knew ſufficiently that it was wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and without reaſon, or the Word of God; nevertheleſſe, the extremitie and neceſſitie of the one made them ſubmit even in that point, depriving themſelves of ſomethings which juſtly belonged to them to give them to the Biſhop, from whom they expected aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance; and the vanitie which did creep in and diffuſe it ſelfe in the hearts, made many Popes receive thoſe titles without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction (at leaſt apparant) or oppoſition that was capable to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the progreſſe.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Sylveſter</hi> his time indeed, it did cleerly appeare that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and authoritie of the Biſhop of Rome did grow and increaſe mightily; Nevertheleſſe, the title of general Paſtour or univerſall head of Biſhops, or Vicar of Chriſt Jeſus on earth was not yet in uſe, nor was it given or uſurped by any: and the firſt Biſhop of Rome in whoſe time the title of univerſall Biſhop began to be ſpoken of, was <hi>Gregory,</hi> who lived above an hundred and fiftie yeares after <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> between the fifth and ſixth age; I call them
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:156624:36"/>
and others, Saints, after the manner of the Romiſh Church, that it may the better be knowne of whom I ſpeake, I having no purpoſe here to queſtion their holines, ſeeing alſo the Apoſtle calleth all Chriſtians Saints; and although it is apparant, that the puritie of the Church was already much changed under this Pope, yet he had modeſty enough, pertinently to refuſe this title which was offered him, and to reprove and blame the ſame ſeverely in the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who challenged and uſurped that which hitherto had been attempted by none other.

               <p>There was at that time in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> a Biſhop named <hi>Iohn,</hi> a man exceeding ambitious, deſiring to extend the limits of his Dioceſſe as far as was thoſe of the Empire, and uſurpe the title of univerſall Biſhop over the whole Church; even as the Emperour who had his reſidence in that Citie, was generall and univerſall Monarch of the world; a title which before him no Biſhop durſt uſurpe; which <hi>Gregory</hi> Biſhop of Rome ſeeing and conſidering how great conſequence &amp; prejudice it was to his See, and all other Biſhops, he as the moſt potent and remarkable among them (for the cauſes I have already ſet downe) oppoſeth ſtoutly, labouring violently to repell the boldneſſe and temeritie of this uſurper,<note place="margin">Greg. l. <hi>4.</hi> Epiſt. <hi>76.</hi>

                  <hi>Gregory</hi> in thoſe places for the condemning of that title as well in his owne perſon as in <hi>John,</hi> who would not for all ſubmit thereto, but perſiſted ſtill in his preſumption, nor would his ſucceſſour after him for any intreaty part with any thing.</p>
               <p>Judge by thoſe teſtimonies if in thoſe times the Biſhop of Rome was thought or did thinke himſelfe generall Paſtour and Head of the Church, his power and authoritie being already very great, but not yet come to the preſumption of uſurping that dignity and primacy; for that ſeemed to be an uſurpation of ſuch conſequence and prejudice to all other Biſhops, that he durſt not attempt it publikely for feare of a generall oppoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from all other Biſhops, who might alſo have interpoſed the authoritie of the Emperour.</p>
               <p>And howſoever, the Biſhop of Rome at that time did ſhew a great inclination to their primacy for perfecting of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:156624:37"/>
yet did they never dare to aſcribe the ſame to themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was given them by the wicked and perfidious Emperour <hi>Phocas,</hi> who having overcome and taken <hi>Maurice,</hi> ſucceeded in his place; and becauſe he was freely and without any contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion crowned at Rome, in recompence would oblige the <hi>Romans,</hi> and ordained that the Church of Rome ſhould thereafter be chiefe of all the Churches, and that <hi>Boniface</hi> the third then Pope ſhould be univerſall Biſhop, and ſo was the controverſie determined by the power and authoritie of the Emperour.</p>
               <p>If after all this, the title of head univerſall and generall Biſhop ought to be thought of divine right, and of divine and Apoſtolique inſtitution given to the Biſhop of Rome, I have done; beleeving that the gift and declaration of a wicked Emperour, maketh not the Inſtitution divine.</p>
               <p>Thus you may perceive (friendly Reader) that Chriſt never gave it to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter,</hi> and that the Apoſtles never beleeved any ſuch thing, nor did S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe ever imagine to have it or make uſe of it. Yee ſee how almoſt ſix hundred yeares were finiſhed (which queſtionleſſe is a long time) after the death of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, before either the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was eſteemed or did eſteeme himſelfe generall Biſhop and Superiour over the whole Church; and now to ſay that it is the inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt, is it not to thinke men fooles? and beleeve they are geeſe void of all ſenſe and reaſon, not to perceive the impoſture? Nor is there any but ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and weake wits will beleeve it in the Romiſh Church; and if it be any Article of faith (as the Pope &amp; his adherents preach, and as the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> declareth) there is none by that reaſon in the Romiſh Church, but weake judgements, who are in the paths of ſalvation.</p>

                  <p>How the Biſhop of Rome hath and doth labour to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his uſurped Primacy, and after what manner the Pope is elected at this preſent.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Know the Cardinall <hi>Baronius,</hi> a man otherwiſe learned, and of great authoritie in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in his Eccleſiaſticall Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory hath endeavoured, above all things, to ſhew the primacy of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:156624:38"/>
the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as being the principall end and cauſe of all his painfull labours; but I proteſt that he ſaith nothing contrary to all I have ſpoken here of the Hiſtory of the Popes, except onely that he ſtriveth to draw more advantageous conſequences for the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> but with what ſinceritie and ground, the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Reader may judge.</p>
               <p>And becauſe he ſheweth (that which I have granted) that Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were written from divers places, and from many Churches to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ſince S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peters</hi> death, either to have his advice in matter of faith, or clearing of ſome doubts in Religion, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of ſome differences riſen amongſt the Biſhops, as to one of their fellow-Biſhops and brethren, who had great authoritie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, as being the Biſhop of the Metropolis of the world, where the Emperour did reſide; he concludeth every where the primacy; but with very bad conſequences; as doe many more of his fellowes, who taking pay of the Romiſh Church, either for feare to looſe the Benefices they have, or in hope to obtaine better and greater, doe all that lyeth in their power to extoll the ſame, diſſembling often thoſe errours they perceive, and labouring to cloake and excuſe that which they cannot deny.</p>
               <p>Certainly, there is no man who reading the Cardinall <hi>Baronius</hi> with a minde void of paſſion, will not cleerly perceive that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth after that manner; and indeed, according to the policy and wiſdome of this world (which is nevertheleſſe fooliſhneſſe before God) he could not doe otherwiſe; for he was wiſe enough to ſee and foreſee, if he wrote otherwiſe than in the favour of his Holines and the Romiſh Church, he could never have aſpired to the Cardinalſhip which he obtained thereby, nor to the honours and gratifications the Pope imparted to him thereafter, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving maintained ſo advantageouſly his authoritie and pretended rights.</p>
               <p>Now to returne to my purpoſe, the Biſhop of Rome having once obtained the title of univerſall Biſhop and generall Paſtour of the Church, by the donation and inveſture of the Emperour, he being already in poſſeſſion of great authoritie and abundance of great riches, it was not hard for him to maintaine and conſerve it in deſpite of all oppoſitions that were raiſed from time to time by Biſhops who had not ſo much riches and authoritie as he, nor a backe ſtrong enough to conteſt it againſt him, and make him quit the title, but rather hath laboured to exalt himſelfe more
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:156624:38"/>
and more, taking occaſion from the weakneſſe and neceſſitie, or the ſimplicitie and devotion of Princes to augment his authoritie and eſtate.</p>
               <p>And he who by the meanes and beneficence of the Emperours was inveſted in the poſſeſſion of his greatneſſe, primacy, and riches, roſe in a ſmall time to that point, as to ſtrive to depoſe them from their thrones, and uſurp the right of creating and crowning them, make them kiſſe and adore his feet, nay even to ſet his feet upon their necke; abuſing thoſe words of the <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.13. <hi>Thou ſhalt walke upon the Aſpe &amp; Baſiliſque,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 91.13.</note> 
                  <hi>and the Lyon and the Dragon ſhalt thou tread under-foot;</hi> as did <hi>Alexander</hi> the third to the Emperour <hi>Fredericke Barberouſſe;</hi> and his ſonne <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixt (ſaith <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>) being brought to the feet of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, there to receive the Imperiall Crowne upon his knees, and it being ſet upon his head as he was on his knees before the Pope who was on a throne, he beat it off with his foot, ſaying to him with an unſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable arrogancy, Know that as I have had the power to ſet the Crowne on thy head, ſo have I to take it from thee, and deprive thee thereof at my pleaſure. But they took their time and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie of the infirmity and miſery of thoſe afflicted Princes, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe upon them the uſurpation of their Empire.</p>
               <p>And no man of underſtanding will peruſe the Hiſtory, but he may ſee, that as the Emperours had inveſted the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> in the title and qualitie of Head of the Church, ſo for a long time after, they reteined the authority to create and inſtall them in their See, and depoſe and turne them out; neither was any admitted on received, but by conſent of the Emperour: And if in the abſence and diſtance of the Emperour, the <hi>Romanes</hi> at any time medled themſelves with the chooſing of the Pope, they ſent continually to the Emperour to have his conſent; which ſometimes he gave and other times refuſed.</p>
               <p>And becauſe time altereth and changeth all things; that which ſometime before was done by all the Romane people with the aforeſaid conditions, became by little and little to be reduced to the Clergie alone, which as the Pope grew greater and richer, did alſo augment their revenues and power, gathering the crummes from a Table ſo exceſſively furniſhed as was that of the Pope; and ſo the conſent of the Emperour began by little &amp; little to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, but principally then when the Emperours were far diſtant, and taken up in other places with warres and troubles, and had
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:156624:39"/>
neither meanes nor power to oppoſe or contradict that Election; And when they did oppoſe themſelves, it had often divers ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, and occaſioned many ſad Hiſtories, and lamentable Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
               <p>But in the end, the power and riches of the Emperour diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by their diſſolute life, and the revolting of Princes their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and the Church of Rome growing continually in riches and wealth, through the too ſimple devotion and liberalitie of many Princes, the whole power of the Election of the Pope came to the Cardinalls, who in the beginning were the chiefeſt and richeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Clergy of the Citie of Rome, and now are choſen out of divers Nations, but more of <hi>Italy</hi> than of all the reſt of the world together; all of them bearing title of ſome Church in the Citie of Rome; and by them alone at this preſent is the Pope choſen; but with all the corruptions and abominations which can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined in the Election of a Potentate.</p>
               <p>For when it is in queſtion to make a new Pope, there is no paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that is not ſet on worke, there is no indirect means left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſayed, no ſymony that is not committed. The Pope being dead, all is in diſorder and confuſion in the Citie of Rome; every vice and crime is committed there without puniſhment or inquiry, all revenge practiſed; the Officers made by the defunct Pope ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no more power: there is ſixteene or ſeventeene dayes allotted to the Cardinalls, to conveene and enter into the Conclave, which is a place furniſhed with Chambers and little roomes, fitted for the Election.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who pretend to be Pope, make commonly many faire promiſes to obtaine the voices of the Electors; to ſome they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe their Pallaces, to others, Offices and Benefices; to ſome the advancement of their kindred: in a word, all they can imagine profitable to themſelves. The Cardinalls Nephewes of the defunct Popes, as the richeſt and moſt potent of the Romiſh Church, being inriched and made great by the favour and power of their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles, have each of them their factions and Caballs apart, compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of thoſe who are ingaged to them, by benefits and curteſies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and pretended, or in favour of the Cardinalls cap, or ſome other gratifications, given them by the Popes their Unkles, not ſpeaking of their alliances and other conſiderations of neerneſſe they have among them.</p>
               <p>After that, is the faction of Princes, of the Emperour, the King
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:156624:39"/>
of <hi>France, Spaine,</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> of the Princes and Reipublicks of <hi>Italy,</hi> who by their Embaſſadours and Pentioners, labour all of them to have a Pope that favoureth the greatneſſe of their eſtates.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, is the Faction which they call of ſpiritualls, which are they that endeavour to chooſe for Pope, him whom according to their conſcience they thinke moſt proper and fit, and whom they beleeve will be moſt profitable for the Church. But this number is commonly very ſmall; and in the Election of Pope <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the eighth, who at this preſent holdeth the chaire of the Biſhop of Rome of fifty-three Cardinalls, who were preſent in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave for the Election, a Gentleman of the Romiſh Church at that time reſiding at Rome, who hath faithfully written the Hiſtory which is publikely to be ſeen in the Booke of the Empires and States of the world, ſaith that there were but three in all of the ſpirituall faction, which aymed onely at the Election of the beſt, without conſidering the Intreſt of <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spaine,</hi> or any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular benefit or utilitie.</p>
               <p>And alſo after the ſame or a worſe manner, have all the modern Elections been which I have read; as yee may ſee more amply in the Books that are written thereof, ſo common in the world as they need not be ſpecified by me.</p>
               <p>Now as the faction of thoſe good and ſpirituall men, who ayme onely to chooſe the beſt and moſt proper, is queſtionleſſe ever the leaſt and weakeſt; and as the worldly factions are ever the greateſt and ſtrongeſt, it is needleſſe to aske what doth ordinarily follow; and it is a marvell, if a good and impartiall and not factious be choſen for Pope; I ſpeak even according to the beliefe of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church.</p>
               <p>They ſpeak indeed a little of the holy Spirit, and invoke his aſſiſtance, but that is onely with their lips and for ceremony, (the holy Spirit ſhunning ſuch corrupt company, that is ſo little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to receive his motions) thence cometh it, that they are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times moneths, yeares, yea, ten, twenty, thirty, or forty yeares, they cannot nor will not agree; and ſome of them make one Pope, others another; this Pope creating his Cardinalls and Biſhops, and the other his; with what diſorder and ſcandall to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, I leave you to judge; the Earth oftentimes bleeding at their execrations.</p>
               <p>And I may truely ſay that almoſt all the Popes are created by ſymony; for all the Princes well knowing by many experiences
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:156624:40"/>
that the Election of the Popes is ſeldome according to the lawes of conſcience, but by corruption and favour; they are obliged to entertaine, expreſly for that end, Pentioners amongſt the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls, to whom they give yearly Penſions, or ſome fat Benefices of their diſpoſition, and ſo buy their voyces, that at the Election they may have a Pope of their faction.</p>
               <p>The rich and powerfull Cardinalls, who are commonly the Nephewes of the defunct, practiſe the ſame with thoſe who are poore, labouring to gaine and poſſeſſe their Suffrages, either by benefits received, or hope to receive, not indeed to be Popes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their families would become too great, and eat up others, but to reigne under the name of ſome other, whom they cauſed to be elected.</p>
               <p>The Cardinalls who pretend to be Pope, ſpare nothing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to captivate to themſelves voyces and friends; and becauſe oftentimes they be not very rich, they are content to promiſe more than they have a minde to performe, yea more than they are able.</p>
               <p>So by all thoſe faſhions which are moſt common and ordinary, there is almoſt not one who is not choſen by ſymony, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently who entreth not in the Sheepfold, not as a good Paſtour by the doore, but as a ravenous Wolfe, breaking the wall to feed and fill himſelfe with the bloud and ſubſtance of the Sheepe, and not to feed them with the nouriſhment and food of life.</p>
               <p>And becauſe they uſe before the Election to reade ſome Bulls which thunder out the moſt fearfull excommunications and ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema's is poſſible againſt all thoſe who proceed to this election by direct or indirect ſymony, or any other crooked or unlawfull courſes, declaring them unfit and uncapable of any Eccleſiaſticall Office or Benefice; there are almoſt none of thoſe elected, who are not anathamatized with moſt terrible excommunications, and by thoſe Bulls made uncapable to keep the Office; ſo that even there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their election is voide, and their poſſeſſion of no force and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, and all exerciſe of their power invalid; but are even irregular ſo often as they exerciſe any act of their charge, or adminiſter any Sacraments: And nevertheleſſe, they often continue ſo, many years; but as they imagine themſelves to have all power to binde &amp; looſe on earth, ſo doe they quickly looſe themſelves from all thoſe Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema's being once Popes, extending the ſame favour to all thoſe who have aſſiſted them in that myſtery of iniquitie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:156624:40"/>By ſuch corrupt and diabolicall election it hath come to paſſe, that ſuch abominable Monſters the Earth hath ſeen ſit in the chair of <hi>Rome,</hi> that none can read the Hiſtory of the Popes written by Papiſts themſelves, but their hair riſeth with horrour: it is not my intention here to ſet down the abhominations which are to be ſeen in thoſe books, howſoever written with all the moderation poſſible to a favourable Hiſtorian, for I will not here be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed invective, and thoſe who have not read thoſe books ſhould ſuſpect me of that crime in producing ſuch a multitude, as hardly could they beleeve them being written by my hand.</p>

                  <p>A notable reflection upon the uſurped power of the Pope and his election, and how much all Princes, Prelates, and Chriſtians, even Romanes, are interreſſed therein.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Have ſufficiently ſhewne before, that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter</hi> never had the Primacy, and how that which the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> pretendeth, being uſurped, is unlawfull, and of no force.</p>
               <p>But let us ſuppoſe that Jeſus Chriſt did eſtabliſh S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter</hi> for his Vicar on earth, and for Head of the Church after his death; Nay ſuppoſe that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> it will not therefore follow, that the primacie of the Church is bound to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> and that, he muſt be head of the Church, who is created Biſhop of the City of <hi>Rome;</hi> or that the people of <hi>Rome</hi> have the priviledge to give a generall Head to the univerſall Church, as thoſe of the Romiſh Church are forced to confeſſe.</p>
               <p>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter</hi> (ſay they) was Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> and erected his chaire at <hi>Rome,</hi> therefore he hath placed and eſtabliſhed the Primacie there: I am ſure that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter</hi> alſo and firſt was Biſhop of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och,</hi> after the death of the Son of God, therefore the ſeat of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie ſhould be rather at <hi>Antioch.</hi> Yes, but he lived and died at <hi>Rome;</hi> Our Saviour who was the chief Prieſt, and Head of the Church, without controverſie died at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> therefore rather ſhould the Primacie and firſt chaire be: and ſeeing <hi>Moſes</hi> who was principall amongſt the people, and chief Doctor, did exerciſe his office, and die in the Wilderneſſe; therefore ought
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:156624:41"/>
the Iſraelites alſo to make the ſeat of their primacie and principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie in the wilderneſſe.</p>
               <p>They muſt then of neceſſitie ſay that the priviledge of primacie was perſonall and not locall, given to the perſon of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter,</hi> and not to the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> where he ſetled his laſt See; they having as yet found no ſuch paſſage in the holy Scripture, commanding the primacie to be annexed to the Biſhoprick of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If then the primacie of the Church was not bound to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> what right have the Romaniſts had to give a generall head to all Chriſtians, as they have done a long time? And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it had been annexed to him; when it was a queſtion to create a Primate by the courſe of election, all Chriſtians ought to be called to give their voice, either themſelves, or by their depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and chuſe him whom they were to obey; which never being done, ſheweth ſufficiently that election was not lawfull, and ſo other Chriſtians were not obliged to obey him, they having nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther been called, nor had voice in his election; it being the Law of all Canonique election, that all thoſe who have intereſt be called to give their voice and ſuffrages, either themſelves or by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties: But let us leave thoſe ancient elections, and ſee if that which is now adayes, be ſurer and juſter.</p>
               <p>Here Oh Noble Princes and Prelates of the Romiſh Church, I wiſh earneſtly ye would onely lift up your eyes and conſider how much ye are interreſſed in the election of the Popes practiſed now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dayes.</p>
               <p>When it is a queſtion to create a generall and univerſall Paſtor of the Church, I beleeve that all Princes and Paſtors, yea and all Chriſtians ought to be called to elect and chuſe themſelves, or by their deputies, him whom they muſt obey, and who ought to keep and guide their ſouls, and on whom all the good or evill of the Church dependeth; But this is not obſerved; they contenting themſelves with the Cardinals, who repreſent, ſay they, the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of the Church.</p>
               <p>Here I might ask who thoſe Cardinals be whom they call Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Church, and upon whom the Church is ſaid to reſt and move as a doore on the hinges; for from the word <hi>Cardine</hi> is Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall taken; and it is known to every man that ſome of them are ſimple Prieſts, others Biſhops, and others neither Prieſts nor Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, but ordinarily great Lords and Princes, to whom that dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:156624:42"/>
is given for the greatneſſe of their family, the moſt part of them being very rich, and abounding in wealth, and pleaſures, who repreſent nevertheleſſe (as they ſay) the Apoſtles and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Jeſus Chriſt, although the difference be as great betwixt the Cardinals and the Diſciples as betwixt day and night, and a great Chaos between thoſe conditions; and nevertheleſſe theſe are the guides and leaders of the flock of Chriſt, the Counſellours of the univerſall Paſtor, and the onely men can give a Paſtor to the Church.</p>
               <p>But conſider (I pray you) what prejudice it is to Princes and Kingdoms hereby: the Popes labouring to perpetuate that Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy within the families and confines of <hi>Italy,</hi> make of purpoſe a great number of Italians Cardinals, for one of other countreys; and I am full perſwaded if there be ſixtie Cardinals, there are ever more than fourtie of them Italians, and it may be three or foure of every other Nations: and when the Pope is dead, there being but 16. or 17. dayes purpoſely to conveene and make a new election, there are none but the Cardinals in <hi>Italy</hi> can be preſent; ſo it is not to be marvelled if the Pope who is now adayes created, is ever an Italian, it being impoſſible to other Cardinals who are imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their charges or about their Princes to be preſent in time, their number being even too ſmall to contradict or carrie it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were there.</p>
               <p>But I would willingly ask who hath made <hi>Italy</hi> dearer to God than other Kingdoms and Nations, to carry this priviledge, and to give and impoſe a Law upon all other Chriſtians of the world? Was Chriſt Jeſus and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter</hi> born in Italy? they were born and iſſued from Judea: ought Italy (which is but a ſmall peece of ground) to give Laws to the whole world, and to bring all other Chriſtians under their yoke? Is it a Nation of greater worth then is <hi>France, Spaine, Germany,</hi> or other Kingdoms, greater and richer, more powerfull and renowned, than ſhe is, to bring them alſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her Empire? if the Head of the Church ought to be created by election, to make the election juſt, equitable, and lawfull, all Kingdoms ſhould be advertiſed of the day of the election, that they may have time to come or ſend their deputies thither; Let them have equalitie of voice, as many and no more, of <hi>Italy,</hi> than of <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Spaine;</hi> let <hi>Italy</hi> although but little, hold the place of a Kingdom, and have as many voices if they will, as a greater and more powerfull Kingdom, (that might be ſuffered,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:156624:42"/>
and it is all the favour it could pretend) let the election be made at <hi>Rome,</hi> and let the Pope live there if he liſt, this might be born with, providing all the Chriſtian Kingdoms might have time to ſend their deputies, and be received with equalitie of voice and ſuffrage; ſo he who ſhould be choſen in this manner might more lawfully be eſteemed head of the Church, if not by divine, at leaſt by humane right and Eccleſiaſtical policie; and Chriſtians having after this manner contributed and conſented to his election, might have ſome reaſon to acknowledge him for ſuperiour, and obey him.</p>
               <p>But to be elected as he is now adayes; although in all times there had been a head in the Church, he who is elected after this manner cannot be juſtly and lawfully eſteemed for ſuch a one; for the election is altogether unjuſt, and conſequently invalid; and therefore none are bound to obey him; I ſpeak even according to the Laws of the Romiſh Church, ſuppoſing alſo that Jeſus Chriſt had had intention to leave another Head than himſelf to the Church on earth.</p>
               <p>I marvell that Kings and Princes who have ſo great power, and ſo wiſe Counſell neer them, ſhould ſo ſuffer this great injuſtice to be done to all Chriſtians, that depend on their Authority, and take no order with it: are there not as wiſe men, and capable to govern the Church in their Dominions as in <hi>Italy?</hi> Is it neceſſary that it be continually governed at this day by an Italian? and that all the Congregations and orders of the Romiſh Church be alſo governed by men whom the Pope laboureth by his policy to have ever of his Nation, to reign and maintain himſelf with more full power? Thoſe whom this doth concern, know ſufficiently what I mind to ſay.</p>
               <p>And muſt all the goods and almes of Chriſtians ſerve onely to augment and inrich all the families of <hi>Italy,</hi> one after another? and that ſtrangers can never pretend any part in that wherein they have as much intereſt as the others, and the materials of which they furniſh at their proper charge, and to the great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the people, which might be much eaſed, if thoſe innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable ſummes of gold, which go every yeer out of their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions to maintain the diſſoluteneſſe and exceſſe of the Pope and his Court, did remain within the countrey, or were converted to the uſe of the Kings and Princes; nor is it without cauſe that the Italians mock other Popiſh Nations, for ſuffering themſelves to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:156624:43"/>
be ſo gulled by them; and truly they have good reaſon: Let thoſe who have the authoritie and power in their hands look to it if they pleaſe. I ſpeak this even according to the maximes of the Romiſh Church and their worldly policie; but this is not the greateſt evil, nor the thing I intend moſt in this diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>By this it may be ſeen how the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> abuſeth the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Princes and Chriſtians, to maintain himſelf in his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; and howſoever S. <hi>Peter</hi> and the other Apoſtles were ſubject to Princes, he himſelf in his 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2 Chap. 13 verſe, exhorting Chriſtians to all dutifull obedience,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.13</note> and eſpecially that obedience and ſubjection that is due to Kings and Princes. Notwithſtanding the Pope at this day ſaith, that he is exempted from all ſpirituall and temporall Laws and juriſdiction; thinking he holdeth of none but himſelf on earth, labouring to uſurpe the ſame authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie over Kings and Princes, that the Son of God had, and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to himſelf that of our Saviour,<note place="margin">Mat. 28.18</note> 
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18. <hi>All power is given to me in heaven and earth,</hi> but with this difference, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Chriſt had the authority, yet he made no uſe of it, but ever ſubmitted himſelf to Princes and Kings of the earth; and the Pope having not this power, uſurpeth it nevertheleſſe ſo farre as he can.</p>
               <p>Thence cometh it to paſſe, that he would bring under his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and Dominions, Kings and Princes, and pretendeth them all to be ſubject and tributarie to his power, not onely in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, but even in temporall things, and that with that ſubtiltie and craft, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and other Romiſh Doctors call indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect juriſdiction and power; whereby he maketh all the States, Empires and actions of Princes liable to his authoritie; it being impoſſible, but ſome intereſt or pretext of Religion or ſpirituall good be alwayes mixed with it, over which the Pope pretendeth direct authoritie, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And therefore it is a Maxime in the Romiſh Schooles, that he may depoſe, eſtabliſh, and excommunicate Kings, interdict their Dominions and Kingdoms, give all their eſtates in prey to the firſt Conquerour, under the pretext and colour of Religion; and if he think them not ſtongly addicted to maintain his faith and doctrine, or rather if they ſhew not themſelves zealous of the augmentation and conſervation of his greatneſſe and authoritie; for this is the word of the Caballe, and the true cauſe of the uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of ſuch a power, beſides the infallible ambition which is naturall to every one.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:156624:43"/>And grounded upon this maxime, the Pope hath made uſe of that authoritie upon all occaſions, and doth it yet ſo much as he can. Witneſſe that which the Pope hath lately done upon the Dukedomes of <hi>Ferrara</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin</hi> in <hi>Italy;</hi> which States he hath handſomely ſeized upon; and would queſtionleſſe do the ſame or worſe with all other Princes, if his power did equall his will.</p>
               <p>But men are not now ſo ſimple as formerly; and the Popes Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons fright now adayes but few, for now they begin to crack, and moſt Princes are too ſtrong and wiſe now to be led ſo by the noſe, or ſubmit their necks under his feet, as ſome of their Anceſtors did; although I beleeve there would be many Pope <hi>Innocents</hi> found, if there were any Prince like <hi>Frederick Barbaroſſe,</hi> but they of our time are not ſo ſimple.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe he deſiſteth not (as he did in ancient time) to abuſe timorous ſpirits, and make the name and intereſts of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter</hi> to reſound loud every where, if a Prince take back that which the Pope had uſurped upon him, he crieth that he robbeth S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter;</hi> if he beg any thing from them to make up his greatneſſe, it is, ſaith he, for S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul;</hi> if any refuſe him, they refuſe S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> ſaith he; Oh but S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter</hi> will be warie to take part in all thoſe greatneſſes and worldly vanities which are ſo contrary to his exhortations, ſo far from his examples, and ſo little beſeeming the office of a true Paſtor of ſouls, and a Chriſtian Prieſt.</p>
               <p>But thoſe pretexts have ſerved him very much to deceive and cozen a number of ſimple Princes, with whoſe goods he being once enriched, thereafter becometh more potent and proud to make war againſt them, and ruine them utterly and their ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours; or elſe hath inriched his kindred, and increaſed and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented his eſtate in ſuch ſort, that it far exceedeth at this preſent that of the greateſt Princes of Europe.</p>
               <p>For what Prince is there at this preſent in Europe who hath 24000. crowns to ſpend every day as the Pope of <hi>Rome?</hi> and all this either begged or uſurped under the name and pretext of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter.</hi> But I would willingly demand, if he worketh the works of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter,</hi> and liveth as he did ſo to borrow his name; had S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter</hi> as great wealth? did he make as great chear? and keep ſuch a Court? or ſo much inriched his kindred? did S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter</hi> govern his Church with ſo great ſtate and pompe? Yes truly with greater povertie, zeal, and modeſty, with greater ſanctitie and edification; and I fear much that thoſe who uſe ſo wrongfully the name of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:156624:44"/>
                  <hi>Peter,</hi> be condemned one day by the example of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter,</hi> whoſe name and cloke they uſe, not imitating his works.</p>
               <p>I know they find reaſons to cover that magnificence and gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering vanity; but there is nothing in the world how abſurd and bad ſoever, but the ſpirit of man can give ſome reaſon for it; and if the fooliſh and ridiculous faſhion ſhould come in the world, to walk with the feet upwards, and the head downwards, ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon might be given of it, as did that people which cut off young girles feet in their Countrey; but if thoſe reaſons be worthy to be received, let men judge.</p>
               <p>And if the Popes complain (as they do) of the contempt of the Princes of our age towards them; let them live as did S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter,</hi> whoſe name they carrie, then Princes and all Chriſtians will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect them as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed every one now ſeeth and confeſſeth, that the lay Lords have been (in a manner) too ſimple, ſuffering themſelves to be ſo eaſily cozened by the craft and inſatiable avarice of the Romiſh Clergie, who under pretext of devotion, of Purgatory, and long prayers (as ſaith the Evangeliſt) have ſnatched the pleaſanteſt and ſweeteſt part of all the wealth in Chriſtendome: (But of this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance in another place.)</p>
               <p>At this time men are wiſer, and go no more in proceſſion from far countreys to kiſſe the Popes pantofle; and if any go for the preſent, it is more through curioſitie than for reſpect and devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; though they ceaſe not to tranſport many Millions of gold daily out of ſome Kingdoms, (to the great grief of many wiſe and good men) and carry it to <hi>Rome,</hi> to entertain the Popes Court in the pleaſures and inſolencies known to moſt men, to inrich his Nephews and kinsfolks, and whorle the Cardinals with a cortage of fourty or fiftie Coaches; in a word, to maintain the Romiſh Clergie in ſuch abominations and diſſoluteneſſe, that S. <hi>Lewes</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> could never have the heart to ſee them; they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing in exceſſe and diſſoluteneſſe all the Cities of the world, even thoſe where Chriſt Jeſus and Gods Name is not known.</p>
               <p>Let the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> have whereon to live, and make good cheer (if he will) ſo long as he liveth, (that were ſufferable) but to have 24000. crowns to ſpend every day is a little too much for an old Prieſt; and I beleeve that the over-plus would do an infinite of good to many poore Chriſtians, Prieſts and Prelates alſo, both learned and underſtanding, who are conſtrained to live poorely
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:156624:44"/>
all the reſt of their daies (and I may ſay to faſt) that they may ſend exceſſive Annates to Rome, to feed his hounds and maintaine his exceſſe.</p>
               <p>Happy and wiſe are thoſe Kingdomes, and States, who have freed themſelves from that tyranny, and withdrawne their necks from under that hard and unſupportable yoake. I know the Pope is much grieved and fretteth daily for having by his preſumption and obſtinacy given occaſion to thoſe Princes, to open their eyes and ſee the darkneſſe and captivitie wherein they lived, and will beware to ſtirre ſo much another time, for feare his throne ſhould fall flat to the ground: But there is no remedy for that which is paſt, nor is there any appearance, they will ever returne and come back to the ancient collection of <hi>Peters</hi> penny.</p>
               <p>Mens eyes are too open now againe to be deceived, and their noſes too apt to ſmell out their plots, which they are daily about to try, and would gladly execute if they could; he ſendeth Agents and imployeth ſpyes and men diſguiſed, eſpecially of ſome orders; who goe ſecretly from houſe to houſe, preaching his Indulgences and pardons, to move the people to acknowledge him, and reſtore his former revenues, (for this is the onely end of all his Inventions what ever pretext of faith and Religion he pretend,) but the carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of thoſe Indulgences are no more in requeſt, and are onely good for nothing, but to cheat women and weak ſpirits; the world hath had ſo many of his Bulls and pardons, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve they will have no more need, but may live without them the ages to come; and wiſe Princes choſe rather to keepe their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys for the eaſe of their ſubjects and conſervation of their eſtates, than to ſend it to the Pope to maintaine his Court in riot, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich his kindred; the falſeneſſe of his doctrine appearing too cleerly now to be embraced by judicious and cleer-ſighted men.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>How abſurd is, and how little ground hath the pretended infallibilitie of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that it is not without cauſe he is called Antichriſt.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Biſhop of Rome is not onely content to challenge the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy and ſuperioritie over the whole Chriſtian Church, but
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:156624:45"/>
to ſtrengthen and increaſe his credit, he falleth into a folly inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable to every wiſe and underſtanding man; for he attributeth to himſelfe the ſame infallibilitie and truth that God doth, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming and maintaining that he cannot erre, no more than God, when he pronounceth any ſentence in matter of faith. This ſeemed to me a cunning ſubtilty, if it were as eaſily to be beleeved as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented; for wanting the word of God and ſufficient Scripture to eſtabliſh his primacy and univerſall ſuperioritie, he hath reſolved to attribute to himſelfe the infallibilitie, to make men receive the Scriptures according to his explication, to ground his authoritie and eſtabliſh his doctrine thereby.</p>
               <p>And this Article of infallibilitie is at this day come to ſuch a paſſe in the Romiſh Church, that it muſt be beleeved as pertaining to faith, and neceſſary to ſalvation; it being forbidden under the paine of being holden for an heretique, and Anathematized for preaching to the contrary; and truely it is a doctrine which in policy ought to follow that of the primacy, for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a perfect and abſolute authoritie. But as wee have ſhewen this primacy to be uſurped and invalid, ſo doe we beleeve we have ſufficiently nullified all that followeth upon thoſe prerogatives, whereof this is the principall; Notwithſtanding, for the greater ſatisfaction of the courteous Reader, wee ſhall anſwer briefly the principall reaſons they bring to prove this doctrine.</p>
               <p>The firſt Objection is drawne out of a paſſage alledged before, where it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Mat. 16.18.</note> 
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18. <hi>Thou art Peter, and upon this Rocke will I build my Church, and the gates of hell ſhall not prevaile againſt it.</hi> This (ſay they) being underſtood of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter,</hi> is to ſay that errour and untruth ſhall not prevaile againſt <hi>Peter,</hi> nor have victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over him; and that he ſhall never be deceived nor erre, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the Pope, who tearmeth himſelfe ſucceſſour of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> having erred after theſe words were pronounced, and denied his Maſter, (which is the greateſt fall that can be in the faith) ſheweth that thoſe words are not underſtood of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter,</hi> but of the faith and confeſſion he made at that time, which being moſt true, and the truth it ſelfe, ſhall never be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come nor ſurmounted by the gates of hell, but ſhall continue in ſtrength eternally; and ſo it is in vaine for the Pope to ground his infallibilitie upon words which are not ſpoken of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter,</hi> nor conſequently of him, as is moſt manifeſt, and as I have ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:156624:45"/>Another Objection which the Romiſh Church thinks ſtronger and more expreſſe is this, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.32. <hi>The Lord ſaid to Simon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 22.32.</note> 
                  <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon behold Sathan hath ſought to winnow thee as wheat, but I have prayed for thee that thy faith faile not; and then when thou ſhalt be converted, ſtrengthen thy brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For my part I perceive not what they would conclude thereby, but that the faith of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould never faile, and yet wee ſee that it failed much, and that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> did ſtumble and erre groſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the faith, having denyed his Maſter a long time after thoſe words were ſpoken. If then that be underſtood as they would have it, the prayers of Chriſt ſhould be of none effect, (which is blaſphemy to thinke,) wherefore we muſt finde out a truer mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe words, and ſay that is underſtood of ſmall falling, Chriſt Jeſus ſaying to <hi>Simon, Simon</hi> I have prayed for thee that thy faith faile not finally; that is to ſay, if peradventure thou ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combe and fall (as thou wilt) at leaſt raiſe thy ſelfe, and enter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into the profeſſion of faith, and being converted by a true repentance, thou muſt confirme thy brethren, and let this fall make thee wiſer in time to come, and be a means to thee to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme others, and exhort them to take heed, leaſt they ſlide and fall as thou. This is doubtleſſe the true and lawfull meaning of thoſe words (as every underſtanding man may judge) and not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Romiſh Church, which every reaſonable man will finde to be altogether abſurd, and invented of purpoſe to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh a falſe doctrine.</p>
               <p>And although it could be proved that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> did never fall, and we ſhould confeſſe that the infallibilitie was given to him: Will it therefore follow, that it is given to all his ſucceſſours alſo? and that which was ſaid to one perſon, and of one perſon, muſt be ſaid to all his ſucceſſours, and of them all? if they apply to the Pope all that was ſaid to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle, and in his favour by Chriſt Jeſus, why doe they not apply as well all that was ſaid to his diſgrace? and ſo the Pope muſt be called Sathan, becauſe Chriſt did call <hi>Peter</hi> ſo; thoſe words muſt alſo be applyed to the Pope, <hi>Thou ſhalt deny mee,</hi> as our Saviour ſpake them to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter.</hi> This certainly hath too often falne out, to the great hurt and ſcandall of Chriſtian people; although (I confeſſe) that our Saviour ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Peter,</hi> did not meane it of thoſe who ſhould be thought his ſucceſſours.</p>
               <p>Now theſe are the ſtrongeſt paſſages and arguments, on which
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:156624:46"/>
this pretended infallibilitie is grounded, which is the whole foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and baſis of all the Romiſh Doctrine now in controverſie, which being proved to be uſurped againſt reaſon and equitie, as the primacy whereon it is grounded; you ſee in what eſtate of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and hereſie that Church is in, and how blinde and deceived they are that follow it.</p>
               <p>It was thought formerly ſtrange, that the Pope of Rome was called Antichriſt, and (I confeſſe) it was long before I could be ſatisfied with the application of this name to the Pope, thinking it was too rigorouſly ſpoken, and with too ſmall ground; but when I came to conſider and examine the ground more narrowly, I thought they had reaſon ſufficient for ſo doing, eſpecially for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to himſelfe the infallibilitie, which is onely proper to God, and which is the moſt execrable blaſphemy, Antichriſt can commit; and the greateſt of his offences, mentioned by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

               <p>Making himſelfe further to be adored as God, yea more than God, cauſing men to carry him upon their ſhoulders at the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Sacrament, where that which they call the Hoaſt, or body of the Son of God, is onely carried on horſebacke, cauſing Chriſtians, yea, Nobles and Princes, to kiſſe and adore his feete, and laying the holy Scripture at his feete. And when he celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Maſſe, his Chaplaines uſe a great deale more reverence and ceremony about his perſon, than they doe about the Altar and Hoaſt: with an infinite number of other things, proper to the ſonne of perdition, deſcribed by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                  <p>The ſumme and concluſion of the former Diſcourſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the uſurped Primacy and infallibilitie of the Pope.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>YOu have ſeen (good Reader) how I have clearly ſhewed, that the Romiſh Church which maketh the primacie and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie an Article of faith, ſet down eſpecially in the Confeſſion of faith of the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> can produce no paſſage of holy Scripture that proveth it with the leaſt ground or reaſon; you have ſeen how I (not being obliged to prove the negative by Scripture) have notwithſtanding by the ſame word of God ſhewed cleerly enough, that Chriſt Jeſus had never intention to give that primacy to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> as the Apoſtles did never beleeve nor acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it, and that S. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf did never think it, nor make uſe of it; and conſequently, that it is falſly attributed to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> although he were ſucceſſour to S. <hi>Peter</hi> in the Biſhoprick of <hi>Rome,</hi> (which is a great controverſie.)</p>
               <p>You have alſo ſeen that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was never called nor acknowledged for head of the Church, or univerſall Paſtor, the firſt 300. yeers without controverſie, yea for almoſt 500. yeers (which is a very great and long time) and further, that he never aſſumed, but rather rejected that title as wicked, damnable, and arrogant, and proper to Antichriſt, never uſing that Authority.</p>
               <p>It hath been ſhewed you how this uſurpation was brought in, and how it hath been maintained, in what caſe it may be in at this preſent, and by what unjuſt and tyrannicall means that unlawfull Authoritie reigneth in the world, to the great prejudice of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and oppreſſion of Prelates; and to the great ſcandall and hurt of all poore and ſimple Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Lift up therefore the eyes of your underſtandings, and conclude with me, that this power being uſurped, is unlawfull and void, (as it appeareth) is in vain, and without reaſon ſaid to be the rule of faith, that it appropriateth to it ſelf the infallible explication of the holy Scripture, and the priviledge to declare the Articles of faith.</p>
               <p>It is in vain then that it ſendeth us to its Synods and Councels, which preſume to have no authority but from him who hath none
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:156624:47"/>
himſelf, neither to call nor confirm them, and all the Canons that were ever made under that unlawfull authoritie, have neither force nor vertue, neither can they oblige any Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>All the Canons and Conſtitutions therefore eſtabliſhed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Popes of Rome and their Councels, are of no force nor ſtrength; neither can they oblige any man.</p>
               <p>Therefore all the Excommunications and Anathema's, all the commandments and prohibitions iſſuing and coming from ſuch an Authority, which are numberleſſe, ought to be rejected and ſet at naught, (if they have no other authoritie from the Word of God) as void and unlawfull, and cruell burthens laid on mens ſhoulders to hold them in ſlaverie, as thoſe of the Phariſees con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and accurſed by God himſelf.</p>
               <p>Compare, I pray you (courteous Reader) the Commandments of God with thoſe of the Church and Pope, and you ſhall ſee that the Commandments of God are eaſie,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.30.</note> and his yoke is light, (as he hath ſaid) and that the commandments of the Church which the Pope affirmeth to be of equall authoritie with Gods, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable burthens, and cords to ſtrangle the conſciences, and ſnares to precipitate them into hell: Open therefore your eyes, O ye people, and behold your blindneſſe and the captivitie in which ye live ſo miſerable;<note place="margin">Iſa. 52.2.</note> 
                  <hi>Looſe the chains from off thy necke, poore ſlave, and captive daughter of Sion,</hi> may I ſay unto you with <hi>Iſaiah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know that many Biſhops and Prelates, men of great learning and honeſt converſation, yea the moſt part of the Prelates of the Romiſh Church, mourn and groan under the weight of that yoke, and wiſh nothing more than the happy occaſion to ſee themſelves delivered, complaining often amongſt themſelves, and making their complaints reſound in the eares of their truſty friends; I know aſſuredly (as having heard it from their mouthes) that they are of the opinion of the ancient Biſhops, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were equals according to the teſtimonie of the Scriptures, and that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is no more than their equall, their fellow Biſhop and brother; not their ſuperiour, although one of the greateſt amongſt them, becauſe of the greatneſſe of the City of <hi>Rome</hi> where he reſideth, as they of the firſt ages did eſteeme: I know they ſee and acknowledge that it is nothing but an uſurpation begun by the liberality of great Princes, and brought in by the ambition of the Popes, and the indiſcretion of the wicked Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, maintained by force during the weakneſſe and calamities of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:156624:47"/>
the Emperours, and the diſſention and diviſion of States, and yet tontinue at this preſent by unlawfull policies and courſes, under the bountie of ſoveraigne Monarchs who ſuffer it.</p>
               <p>All the learnedſt and moſt judicious of the Romiſh Church ſee and deplore this miſerie and tyranny; but to open their mouth aloud and in publique, is a thing which none dare attempt under the Popes authoritie; for beſides the excommunications and Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema's which will not be wanting to terrifie the ſimpler, beſides the priſons and other corporall puniſhments where the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reigneth; they muſt expect (where the Pope hath any credit with Princes) to be quickly deprived of all the Church Revenues they poſſeſſe, and out of hope to get any more; which verily are too ſtrong motives to retain many, who have not ſufficient cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and who by puſillanimity, and thoſe temporall reſpects, are forced to keep ſilence, and yeeld as <hi>dumbe dogs which dare not barke,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 56.10.</note> ſeeing the woolfe fall upon the flock, as ſaith <hi>Iſaiah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Would to God Princes would once relliſh this important truth, which a great many of their ableſt Subjects do acknowledge, and open their eyes to ſee the captivitie under which they go about to oppreſſe their authoritie; God of heaven make them ſee their ſervitude, and give them reſolution to deliver themſelves and their Subjects from under that ſtrange and cruell yoke.</p>
               <p>I am perſwaded if once this great abuſe were out of the Church, if this unjuſt and incompetent Judge were once rejected, as an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper of an authority not belonging to him, all Chriſtians would in a ſhort time be of one flock, and under one Paſtor Chriſt Jeſus; and in a ſhort time there would be through all <hi>Europe,</hi> and other places of the earth, but one faith, one baptiſme, one God; for the holy Scriptures entring to be Judge and Rule of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies in point of Religion, there would be no man of ſpirit and judgement who would not in a ſhort time know the truth, and the darkneſſe of error would quickly be diſſipated by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the light.</p>
               <p>But from this incompetent Judge doth proceed all the miſerie of the Church, and becauſe that point is the moſt important of all others in controverſie, I have ſtayed longeſt upon it, and laboured to deduce and cleer the ſame more amply, as being that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I did moſt ground my converſion, and the change which I have made.</p>
               <p>And becauſe I know there be yet many points, which for not
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:156624:48"/>
being ſufficiently cleered, are the cauſe of the perdition of many, I ſhall endeavour to ſpeak ſomething of them in the following Chapters, according to the light God hath given me, and the knowledge I did acquire being in the Romiſh Church: not that I promiſe to ſet them down ſo amply as I have done the precedent points; For having proved evidently that rejecting the judgement of the Pope as unlawfull, and of no force, we ought to take the Scriptures and Word of God alone, to judge all our controverſies in matter of faith; all, that cannot be ſhewed in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures muſt be baniſhed out of our beleef: and becauſe they of the Romiſh Church confeſſe, that in many points they have no Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture nor ground, it is by conſequence to avow and confeſſe the nullitie thereof; neither need we any other form of proceſſe to condemne them of untruth, ſo that which I ſhall write hereafter ſhall onely be for the greater ſatisfaction of the Reader, and to open the eyes of many ſimple ſouls who ſee not their blindneſſe and darkneſſe.</p>

                  <p>Of the Invocation of Saints.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AFter that I was ſufficiently informed, and fully ſatisfied, by thoſe reaſons and conſiderations I have already deduced, and others like to them, which to avoid prolixity I omitted, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pope nor the Church ought to be my Judge in matter of faith, but the holy Scripture onely, which God hath given us to that end; then did I begin to examine all points of faith by the Scripture alone, and in every thing that was propounded to me by the Romiſh Church I had recourſe to the Word of God, and holy writings, to ſee if it was conformable to them; and if any ſuch thing were preached by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, who have queſtionleſſe divulged the pure and moſt perfect faith, that being the thing every Chriſtian ought to practiſe in matter of faith.</p>
               <p>And perceiving the point of the Invocation of Saints to be at this preſent in great eſtimation in the Romiſh Church, and that the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nfeſſion and profeſſion of faith ordered by the Bull of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, according to the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> ſaith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, we muſt honour and invoke the Saints: I have ſearched and examined this point by the holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:156624:48"/>I confeſſe truly that as my nature moveth me enough (praiſed be God) to give honour to thoſe to whom it appertaineth, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in holy things, ſo have I ever had an inclination to render to the Saints, as much honour and reſpect, as I thought was due to them; and if I ſhould have found any ground in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the Invocation of Saints, I would certainly have embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it with a hearty affection; but knowing that God is better pleaſed with obedience than will-ſacrifice, ſo I did beleeve the Saints demanded nothing more of us than what was due to them, and that we are ſo far from doing them pleaſure in giving them more honour than juſtly appertains to them, that it were rather to offend God, and them in God, who loving him above all things have no other glory nor pleaſure than his glory and will.</p>
               <p>Now for paſſages out of the holy Scriptures to prove this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, the Romaniſts produce none worthy of conſideration; and that which ever I did read of greateſt importance for them,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This paſſage is falſified, for it is according to the Greek, <hi>I will endeavour that you may be able after my deceaſe to have thoſe things ſtill in remembrance:</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Theod.

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:156624:49"/>
of the ſame Councell,<note place="margin">Concil. Triden. Seſſio <hi>25.</hi> de Reform. cap. <hi>20.</hi>
                  </note> and eſpecially by Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.) hath thoſe words, <hi>(I beleeve the Saints muſt be honoured and invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, who reign together with Chriſt, and that they offer up prayers to God for us.)</hi> Thence it would appeare that this good Father did not well know his belief; for behold, his Church beleeveth that Saints muſt be honoured and invocated; if it be not peradventure that he would put this gloſſe upon the words of the Councell, to wit, that the obligation is onely by way of counſell, and not a commandment; but they might ſay as much of all hereſie, and the word <hi>(I beleeve)</hi> ſheweth they make an Article of faith of it, which obligeth them all.</p>
               <p>But let us grant, if you will, that all the Saints who are with God in glory offer continuall prayers to him for the increaſe and proſperitie of the whole Church and all the faithful, (as ſome Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors beleeve:) and perhaps might be granted, although we have no knowledge thereof from the holy Scripture, (and ſo it cannot be a point of faith;) it will not therefore follow that they hear all our prayers, and know our neceſſities in particular, or that we ought to invoke them; and the faſhion in which the Romiſh Church explaineth this point, ſheweth ſufficiently its nullity.</p>
               <p>For they ſay the Saints do not hear our prayers themſelves, but beholding and contemplating the divine Eſſence, they ſee them there as in a glaſſe, and ſo have knowledge of them; and although (ſay they) they ſee whole God, yet they do not ſee him wholly, nor do they ſee all which is comprehended in that divine Eſſence, for ſo ſhould they have an infinite knowledge; but they ſee onely that which God will manifeſt and reveal unto them.</p>
               <p>Now to beleeve God manifeſted unto them all the prayers that are directed unto them, is a groundleſſe conjecture, there being no Word of God to inform us thereof, nor any returned from thoſe places to bring us news. And although this might be, there being nothing impoſſible to God, nevertheleſſe all confeſſe and agree, that every thing which is poſſible to God cometh not therefore to paſſe, nor ought we beleeve it to be done, if the Word of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth it not to us as matter of faith; beſides there are ſo great ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities in the explication of this doctrine, that I marvell how it can enter into the ſpirit of a reaſonable man.</p>
               <p>For they confeſſe that our prayers go firſt to God, and then from God to the Saints, and after they return from the Saints to God, which is as one praying to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Nicholas</hi> (for example) if
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:156624:49"/>
God ſay to him, <hi>Nicholas</hi> know that ſuch a man in ſuch a place upon the earth asketh thee ſuch things, whereof I advertiſe thee, that thou may pray to me, and then I will adviſe if I ſhall heare thee, that is, to make God Mediatour towards the Saints, before the Saints be Mediatours towards God.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the Saints have not an infinite knowledge and vertue, and as they know not all things, ſo doe they not know them all at one time, and are not as God, who provideth for the generall government of the world, and all particular things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, without any trouble or diſturbance; for the infiniteneſſe of his divine eſſence giveth him that power; but the Saints are not ſo; for although their power be great, yet it hath its owne bounds; nor I cannot conceive how a Saint at the ſame inſtant can heare all the prayers made to him here on earth, nor how he can provide for all, as they make the ſimpler beleeve.</p>
               <p>For let us ſuppoſe (if yee will) that it is Saterday, which day the Romaniſts dedicate eſpecially to the bleſſed Virgin, Mother of God; or one of her great holy dayes among them; as of her Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivitie, her Aſſumption, or any other, from the dawning of the day to mid-day, there are a million of millions of Maſſes ſaid every moment in thoſe places where Popiſh Religion is planted, and a numberleſſe number of prayers at one and the ſame inſtant are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the bleſſed Virgin, every particular perſon imagining ſhee heareth them perfectly, and indeavouring to make his wants knowne to her, to the end he may be relieved; or ſuppoſe ſhee knoweth them already, and that they onely labour to pray to her and aske her helpe and reliefe; they will be forced to confeſſe that the prayers and neceſſities of every particular perſon goe firſt to God, who alone knoweth the hearts, and then from God to the Virgin, and from her againe to God; laſt of all they returne from God to the Virgin, that ſhee may give order and make them feele their prayers are granted, if God think it expedient. Now if there be two thouſand perſons in a Church that pray to the Virgin at one time, it muſt be done by every one of them in an inſtant; and if there be ten thouſand in a Citie which pray at one time, that muſt be done by every one of them ſo; and if that be done pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably through all the Cities of a Kingdome, even of many Kingdomes, where a numberleſſe number of people pray to the bleſſed Virgin at the ſame inſtant, ſhee muſt have at one time an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite multitude of buſineſſes to heare, and neceſſities to provide
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:156624:50"/>
for, and at the ſame inſtant God informeth her of an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of prayers directed to her for an infinite number of wants, ſhee returning an infinite number at the ſame time to God; and in the meane time, while ſhee returneth them to God, and prayeth to him, according to the information it pleaſed him to give her, God at the ſame inſtant advertiſeth her of an infinite multitude of other prayers; which indeed may well be done by God at an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, but not by the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> who being onely a finite crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is not able to thinke and adviſe upon ſo many affaires toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at one time no more than we; but needeth ſome time and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to know &amp; provide for all, though we confeſſe, that a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated ſoule may know ſooner than united to the body, and that ſhee know by a ſingle apprehenſion and not by diſcourſe; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing finite, her power of knowing is finite, and ſhee cannot know all together, nor thinke upon all at once, being ever in ſtate of glory.</p>
               <p>And let us but grant the leaſt time to every buſineſſe, we would quickly be far from our intent; for there being ſome dayes milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of millions of affaires and prayers directed to her through the world, ſhee cannot imploy the ſmalleſt time imaginable in every buſineſſe, but ſhee muſt be more than a yeare to thinke and looke upon all the affaires which are directed to her in one day, nay in one houre, nay in a quarter of an houre. And becauſe it falleth out often in a yeare, we muſt of neceſſitie fall into an inexplicable labyrinth to every tongue, inconceivable to every underſtanding, and impoſſible to every creature, how perfect ſoever ſhee is, there being nothing but that which is infinite capable of ſuch things, the which ought not to be acknowledged in any Saint whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
               <p>But to what purpoſe (I pray you) ſhall we addreſſe our ſelves to Saints? ſeeing we have our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is the true Mediatour, the Soveraigne and onely Advocate betwixt us and his Father, who commandeth us to come and addreſſe our ſelves unto him, who giveth us the confidence, and aſſureth us that he will comfort us;<note place="margin">Mat. 11.28.</note>

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:156624:50"/>
be aſſured yee ſhall finde conſolation. Is there any Saint in the world, to whom we have ſo great reaſon to addreſſe our ſelves, as to Jeſus Chriſt our God? who ever hath commanded and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked us to come to him? who hath called and charged us? who hath ever ſaid come to me? who hath given us ſo great confidence? and to whom ought we to beleeve, and to truſt ſo much? is there any Saint ſo able to aſſiſt us? and who can comfort us ſo much in all our afflictions, and heale us ſo well of our diſeaſes? or ſo quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and powerfully helpe us in all our croſſes as he? Is there any Saint that hath aſſured us ſo much of his good will towards us? Is there any Saint in whom and on whom we can truſt and repoſe our ſelves ſo freely? To what purpoſe then ſhould we goe and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe our ſelves rather to the Saints, than to him who is our God and omnipotent Father, and who infinitely deſireth our well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.</p>
               <p>It is eaſie by that which I have ſaid, and which I am to ſay, to anſwer the objection Papiſts commonly have and imagine to be ſtrong, drawne from the compariſon of Princes and Mediatours, which men uſe to goe to them, and to doe their buſineſſe the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for it is not ſo in God; we goe not directly to Princes either becauſe they know us not, or becauſe we are not ſure of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards us, or if they be minded to doe us good; but this hath no place in God; for we are certaine he loveth us, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and willeth our good; it is moreover his will, and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth us to come to him; ſo we have no need to interpoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and having no commandement to doe it, nor example in holy Scripture, nor any reaſon in the world, we cannot doe it without offence.</p>
               <p>And we need not doubt but the Apoſtles had a ſufficient incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to honour the Saints which were before them; yet we ſee not in any place of Scripture, that ever any of the Apoſtles did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke any of the Saints, either before or after the death of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; or that he ever recommended that doctrine: if this had been an Article of faith, and of ſo great importance, doe yee not thinke they would have left ſomething of it in ſome one of their Epiſtles? or S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Luke</hi> in the Acts? which no where appearing, it is a manifeſt ſigne Chriſt Jeſus did never teach it, and that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his will we ſhould practice it.</p>

what reaſon and ground ought we to doe it? Shall we thinke our ſelves wiſer than Chriſt and his Apoſtles? and doth it not appeare to be a humane invention and addition to the Word of God? which is curſed from his mouth, and threatned with an Anathema by the Apoſtle S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, if we interpoſe Chriſt, who is our true and ſoveraigne Mediatour, is there any that can deny that our prayers are not as well and better made, as if we did interpoſe all the Saints: to what purpoſe is it then to interpoſe S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

               <p>And there is no man who would not confeſſe, but it is better to pray to God and to Jeſus Chriſt, than to the Saints, and addreſſe our ſelves to him rather than to them; becauſe wee have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement for the one and not for the other. Seeing then it is better to addreſſe our ſelves to God than to the Saints, we having no commandement nor counſell in the holy Scripture, nor any example in the lives of the Apoſtles, who were better Chriſtians than wee, and who had a greater inclination and affection than wee to honour the Saints; with what reaſon ſhould wee doe it? We ought therefore to reject this as a humane invention, and a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition invented by the Romiſh Church, and which is threatned with Anathema.</p>

                  <p>That Profit temporall is the cauſe of the Invocation of Saints and Images in the Romiſh Church.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS it is manifeſt that the Romiſh Church is wholy builded upon utilitie and profit, ſo is game and lucre the principall cauſe of the article of the invocation of Saints and images; for when the Clergie did perceive that the people (commonly incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſuperſtition) uſing to paſſe many nights at the Sepulchres and Tombes of the Martyrs in faſting and prayers, prayſing and bleſſing God for their conſtancy, did begin to pray to them upon the aſſurance of their felicitie, and hope that their ſoules being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall might heare them, and have credit enough with God to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:156624:51"/>
helps them, and charitie ſufficient to imploy themſelves for them; they did not reprove them for this ſuperſtition, but were glad to finde out theſe means, and uſe the occaſion to draw profit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from.</p>
               <p>Thence came to paſſe, that the Prieſts did reſolve to place the Images of ſuch Saints and Martyrs in their Temples, although they were not buried there, to the end the people relinquiſhing the Tombes and Sepulchres where their bodies did reſt, might come ſee and pray to them repreſented in their Churches; and ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to make their prayers, might leave ſome offering, imagining well they would not returne without ſhewing their liberalities in favour of the Saint, but where the Prieſt &amp; the keeper of the Saint ſhould ever have the beſt part.</p>
               <p>And that abuſe in ſhort time grew to ſuch a diſorder, that every Prieſt laboured in emulation one of another, to place the moſt Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Saints, as was poſſible in his Church, eſpecially to ſet up thoſe the people moſt eſteemed, and to which they came moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and furtheſt; ſo that in the end many Temples are become true Pantheons, there being no corner where ſome big or ſmall Saint had not place; and I have ſeene in ſome Churches where for want of place to erect all their Images in Boſſe, their Pictures were confuſedly drawne one by another; as the 15000 Virgins are, ſhewing onely their faces; to the end that whatſoever Saints the people deſired to adore and pray to, they might be found in their Temples.</p>
               <p>And when they perceived ſome Saints to be more prayed to, and in greater requeſt than others, they were not content onely to ſet their Images in the Churches, to dedicate and conſecrate Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to them: but the avarice of Prieſts hath invented fraternities and Congregations in their honour, which bearing their name, profeſſe themſelves chiefly affected and devoted to thoſe Saints; and to combate and live under their aſſiſtance and protection; theſe congregations and fraternities being often erected in emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation one of another, and alwayes to the utilitie of the Clergie, which can well make profit thereof.</p>
               <p>But as all things have their time, ſo have the Saints had theirs in eſtimation &amp; honour in the Romiſh Church; and the Apoſtles and auncient Martyrs, whom they had in great veneration and eſteeme in old time, at this time have loſt almoſt all their credit among them, there being few that pray (in private eſpecially)

                  <hi>Paul,</hi> and others of the moſt renowned among the Saints; and for the holy Patriarchs of the old Teſtament, as <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob, Job</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> whoſe faith and vertue are recommended by the holy Scriptures, which giveth us a moſt ſure teſtimony of their beatitude and ſanctitie; and of whom Chriſt and his Apoſtles have ſpoken ſo much good; have never had the happineſſe (for any thing that can be perceived) to have been in veneration and honour in the Romiſh Church; nor had never any candles offered them; but they eſpecially which have had much honour and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation amongſt them, have been and are yet ſome new Saints, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonized by the Pope alone, without any other certaine revelation and teſtimony of the Word of God; and to them doe they pray, and honour them more than all the Apoſtles of Chriſt Jeſus toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and all the Patriarchs that ever were; as if they had not ſo much power and credit with God, and were not ſo great Saints in Paradiſe, as thoſe which are canonized by the Pope.</p>
               <p>But I would willingly demand how the Pope can aſſure us of the felicitie of another, being not certaine of his owne? and ſome Pope is ſaid to have canonized Saints, whom they of the Romiſh Church thinke damned for his execrable life and death; and he may have canonized a man who is now in hell: Notwithſtanding ſuch is the abuſe, that they whom the Pope hath declared Saints, are in greater eſtimation, than thoſe of whoſe ſanctitie we are aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the holy Scripture, and that man would be derided now, who ſhould ſay, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                  <hi>Jacob</hi> pray for me, or ſet their portraicts or images in the Churches to be adored, or erect ſome fraternitie or congregation in honour of them.</p>
               <p>But all the devotion <hi>a la mode</hi> is onely towards ſome Saints of a new ſtamp, &amp; the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> who alone hath more Maſſes, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Chappels, and fraternities erected in her honour, than all the perſons of the moſt holy Trinitie have together; and for one Maſſe, one Congregation or prayer to the holy Trinitie, there are an hundred to the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> to whom they pray oftner with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all compariſon than to God, giving her more honour than God; which certainly is a great offence, not onely to God; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to her, who queſtionleſſe abhorreth and deteſteth all thoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours which ſhee knoweth to be due not to her but to her God; ſhee having no other honour nor conſolation, than to ſee her God and Son honoured,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.16.</note> to whom alone all honour and glory doth appertaine, (as witneſſeth the Apoſtle <hi>Paul.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:156624:52"/>And nevertheleſſe, it is the trade and cuſtome of the Romiſh Church, never almoſt to pray to God, but to the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> to make no more vowes to God, but to the Virgin, and the <hi>Pater-noſter,</hi> which is the prayer the Son of God taught us to pray when wee are to pray, is little in uſe for the preſent; but onely prayers to the Virgin, and to Saints; and on the beads, for one <hi>Pater-no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> there be alwayes ten <hi>Avemaria's;</hi> and when the Bell touleth in the morning, at noone, or at night, there is no prayer ſaid to God, but to the virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> and the Preachers at their Sermons ſay never the <hi>Pater-noſter,</hi> but the <hi>Ave maria,</hi> and the <hi>ſancta;</hi> and he who in place of <hi>Ave maria</hi> ſhould ſay the <hi>Pater-noſter,</hi> and for praying to the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> ſhould pray to God, and ſay the Lords Prayer, would be reprehended and cenſured, as having a bad opinion of the faith.</p>
               <p>Now what is all this (I pray you) but errour, ſuperſtition and Idolatry? and to give greater honour and glory to the Saints than to God? to the creatures, than to the creatour? and have the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary</hi> and the Saints in greater eſtimation than our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus himſelfe, our perfect Mediatour, Advocate, and Interceſſour, ſo eſtabliſhed for us by the teſtimony of the Scriptures, to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile us to God, to entercede for us with God, and appeaſe God his Father for us. And what is all this (I pray you) but to make void the will of God, to follow the inventions of men, and to expoſe themſelves to the condemnation pronounced from Gods owne mouth againſt that in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Now for the adoration the Romiſh Church giveth to Saints and Images, although (it may be) the moſt underſtanding and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of that Church adore them not as God; and that by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of adoration of <hi>Dulia</hi> and <hi>Hyperdulia,</hi> they thinke to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt themſelves from Idolatry; or if they were content to keepe their pictures in their houſes, as they doe thoſe of the <hi>Caeſars,</hi> or other excellent perſonages, without exhibiting to them any reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious adoration, that might be tolerated; but expoſing thoſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to the people, and ſetting them in the Churches to be adored, they are the cauſes (at leaſt) the people commit Idolatry towards Saints and Images; for they adore the Saints, and pray to them, and ſpeak to Images as to God; demand health and remedy from the Saints and Images as from God; and if the Images be onely drawne on Tables, they make not ſo much account of them; but
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:156624:53"/>
if they be in Boſſe, and well made, they ſpeake to them, as if they were alive, and carry themſelves altogether towards them, as did the Idolaters towards their Idolls. See what is ſaid in the Booke of <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> which is holden to be Canonicall among them, and judge you if all doth not agree to the moſt part of people in that Church.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Judge I pray you, if all this doth not agree, and is not found in the ſimple people of the Romiſh Church; and if there be not as great reaſon to condemne them of Idolatry, as thoſe of whom it is ſpoken in this place; and are not they which place thoſe Images and expoſe them to the people, which authoriſe them by their doctrines, and ſollicite the people thereunto, the cauſers and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors of Idolatry? But as the Booke of <hi>Wiſdome</hi> ſaith in that place; <hi>The deſire of game hath deviſed that;</hi> for it eſpecially hath been the onely covetouſneſſe of Prieſts and Clergie to gaine and gather the money and offerings of the people, which hath made them expoſe the Images and erect them in the Churches; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many of thoſe Images worth great revenues to the Clergie; and I know ſome worth above ten thouſand Crownes yearely to their Prieſts; and therefore we need not marvell that the Romiſh Clergie, ſo carefully maintaine the doctrine of invocation of Saints and Images.</p>
               <p>For as the people goe but ſeldome to God but by the Saints, ſo doe they but ſeldome goe to the Saints but by the Prieſts, to wit, by their Maſſes, Pilgrimages, and other the like means; and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:156624:53"/>
the ſaints in heaven take no money for their paines, they having no need, they nevertheleſſe which are on the earth can well take it, refuſing nothing although they have no hands; but the Prieſts have hands enough for all; for, they take that which is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them with one hand, &amp; with the other that which is offered to their Images; ſo they handſomely take (as men commonly ſay) two maulters of one ſack; and know how to flea the poore beaſt without noiſe; caring little whether the people commit Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry or not, provided they find their profit.</p>
               <p>And howſoever the Prieſts know well enough, that the people commit idolatry with the Saints and Images in rendring to them the honour that is due to God, nevertheleſſe that doctrine being ſo profitable to them, they are loath to preach againſt it or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it.</p>
               <p>And as a notable and very learned Biſhop of the Romiſh Church who is yet alive, and whom I well know, (a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable in his converſation) did begin not long ago eagerly to preach and write againſt thoſe great abuſes, againſt the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Tiercers, againſt pilgrimages, and thoſe artificiall ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions, and the Idolatries practiſed by the ignorant with vitious ſimplicities, and invented of purpoſe by the Prieſts to ſnatch mens money; thoſe who were the more interreſſed, roſe up againſt him incontinent, and prevailed ſo far by their practiſes with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, that he was forbidden to preach and write, and hath been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced and baniſhed theſe many yeers; although he was eſteemed for that of the moſt judicious, and even of them who did ſolicite againſt him; but profit and gain ſuffocate and ſtrangle oftentimes the reaſon and truth, eſpecially in the Romiſh Church.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THe ſtrongeſt reaſon they of the Romiſh Church have to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſe their invocation of Saints, is an infinite multitude of Miracles, which they ſay were done by the Saints at the prayers of the faithfull; and the book of their miracles is of ſuch credit at this day in that Church, that it is their Word of God and holy Scripture, and the book in greateſt eſtimation among the people;
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:156624:54"/>
and where ſcarcely one Bible is to be found in an whole Pariſh, an hundred books of the life and miracles of Saints are to be ſeen.</p>
               <p>Truly for my part, I once accounted of them as other men did, and becauſe there was many ſtrange accidents ſurpaſſing the force of nature, I took great pleaſure in reading thoſe hiſtories; for it is naturall to our ſpirits to be delighted with things which are not common: thence cometh it to paſſe, that there are but few that are not delighted with the reading of Romans, although they know them to be fabulous, and things invented of purpoſe to paſſe idle time; but when I came to ſound and examine the manner in which thoſe things were left unto us, I found there was but ſmall reaſon to brag of thoſe miracles, or oppoſe them to the Word of God, and practiſe of the Apoſtles, and firſt Chriſtians: for there is none but they know that thoſe books of the Saints, and eſpecially that which is moſt eſteemed at this preſent, and called the flowers of the Saints, compoſed by <hi>Ribadeneyra</hi> a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Jeſuite, hath been extracted out of the ancient Legends and lives of the Saints; in which the moſt judicious of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church (as the Cardinall <hi>Baronius,</hi> and others) acknowledge ſo many abſurdities and lies, that they are aſhamed to hold them for authentique; ſuch is the <hi>Tripartite Hiſtory, Metaphraſtus, Nicephorus, The life of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers and Hermites,</hi> attributed to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Jerome,</hi> who never dreamed of it, <hi>The golden Legend,</hi> and many others of the ſame kind; where it is certain the lives of many Saints are, which were never in the world: Notwithſtanding the Moderns have not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to take out of all thoſe books the things which ſeemed to them leaſt abſurd, and they thought eaſieſt to be beleeved; and ſo have left it to the world, not with more truth, but with more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood of truth.</p>
               <p>But I would willingly ask them, who told them that thoſe things which they have pickt out of thoſe ancient books and old Legends eſteemed to be Apocrypha, are truer than the things they have left behind? For they were not preſent to know it, and all things which might have come to paſſe and been done, are not therefore come to paſſe; and if any Authors have written of them, they have taken them one from another, as divers Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters do.</p>
               <p>So truly all thoſe Authors old and moderne, do not deliver them as holy Scripture, or things certain and infallible; and the more judicious through all ages have never given great credit

thereto: Notwithſtanding becauſe many Authors are cited in them, who write thoſe things which indeed they have never ſeen, but read or learned from their predeceſſours, or found in ſome Manuſcripts, wherein were written many lies and falſe hiſtories, to make them more plauſible, to the end they might ſell better to the people: and to make them the more credible, they write them often under the name of ſome dead Saint, or ſome grave Author who had been famous; and the ſimpler (which make profeſſion to beleeve all that is moulded or printed, eſpecially being dazled with the name of ſo many Authors, (whereof ſome were accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Saints) receive that as Goſpel, firmly beleeving the ſame; but not the more judicious and wiſer amongſt them.</p>
               <p>And as for Miracles, I am not inclined to incredulitie, but I am of ſo eaſie beleefe in that point as a Chriſtian ought to do; and I know and confeſſe, that God being almightie, both can work them when it pleaſeth him, and by whom it pleaſeth him, both by ſinners and Saints, by Infidels and beleevers; and I know and confeſſe, that many miracles have been done by the ſaints in vertue of Gods name, (who onely can work miracles) and that they may be wrought yet every day; and it is credible they are wrought in ſome place, (Gods hand being nothing ſhortned) but miracles are neither infallible marks of the true Church, nor of the true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; God being able to do them (as I have ſaid) by Infidels and Devils.</p>
               <p>And as for the Miracles which the Romiſh Church pretend, and whereof they make ſo great boaſt and noiſe in the eares of the ſimpler, I could never find any ſufficient reaſon to move me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve them; although I have been often very curious, diligently to enquire after the ſame with all poſſible ſinceritie.</p>
               <p>But for my part, I profeſſe firſt of all, never to have ſeen any in any place whereſoever I have been; and moreover, that I never did meet with any man for the ſpace of 30. yeers and more, that I li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Romiſh Church, who could aſſure me he had ſeen any, although I have been in a great number of Churches and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where the people ſaid many miracles were wrought; and where the Prieſts did keep great books ſtuffed with an infinite number of Miracles; and when I was deſirous particularly to know the truth of ſome of them, whereof they made ſo great noiſe, I found it was onely deceits to beguile the ſimpler, and draw more people after them, not to honour God or the Saints
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:156624:55"/>
with their prayers, but to burthen the Prieſts and Clergy with offerings and preſents out of their purſes, for that is the end of the myſterie.</p>
               <p>I will onely hereupon give you this brief hiſtory. When I did remain in a ſea-town famous enough, there was a Paſtor of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance an ingenuous man, and much given to his profit, who perceiving that his Church which was dedicated to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> was not ſo much frequented as ſome other Churches were, and as he deſired; he bethought himſelf of this project and deſigne, to wit, ſome ſimple women paſſing once by the way coming to his Church, he made them beleeve that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> had newly appeared to him, and told him ſhe would be ſingularly worſhipped in his Church; and that whoſoever ſhould viſit it 7. times (mark the ſubtiltie) beſides a multitude of benefits he ſhould receive every time, it ſhould be as profitable to him as if he went to ſee our Dame <hi>de Lieſſe,</hi> which was above an hundred miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and might acquit himſelf from the vow of going thither; but to aſſure you that he ſpake this in formall or obſcure and enig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matique tearmes, I will not affirm it; but howſoever he perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them in ſuch ſort, that they came immediately to the Town where I lived, publiſhing the Miracle in every place; that the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary</hi> was appeard to that Paſtour, and had held ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with him.</p>
               <p>So that the report of this new miracle being divulged abroad, the people, eſpecially women and maids, went running in ſuch a throng from the Town to that Church in pilgrimage (it being diſtant about ſix miles) that there paſſed no day wherein many hundreds went not, even to ſuch exceſſe, that the Paſtour of the Town, a man zealous and jealous of his charge, did ordinarily complain in publique that his Pariſh was deſerted, Gods ſervice neglected, and the women and maidens were in danger to turn whores, they not being able to gain their living in ſo running up and down; In a word, that it was the deceit of the devil; yet were not all his exhortations ſufficient to hinder the ſtreame and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of that unreaſonable multitude.</p>
               <p>And after the example of this famous Town the neighbouring Towns throng thither alſo; and the matter went ſo far, that in leſſe than three yeers, nay than two, the people came thirtie or fourty miles off thither in proceſſion; and mark that none return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth back without leaving ſome feather of their wings; (for that is
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:156624:55"/>
the ground and end of the invention; ſome for confeſſion, others for Maſſes, ſome for Evangils and prayers, ſaid over their heads, others for wax and light, ſome to clothe the Image, and for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of other uſes which want not ſpeciall and religious pretexts, whereof the honeſt Prieſt maketh every where his profit; for although he be not able to do all alone, yet they whom he admitteth to help him, and have ſome part of the ſpoil, muſt often greaſe his fingers, and give him ſome acknowledgement, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes he would be diſcontented, and weary to ſuffer them: there is cunning every where.</p>
               <p>And I being once there, I was very curious to enquire of my friend the Prieſt, the truth of that Miracle which was ſo much ſpoken of far and neer, and as I did ask him what the matter was; he began to ſmile, and told me he knew not what it meant, and that the report was but a meer foolery; but ſuch an anſwer was not for every one; he being wiſe enough for his own profit not to diſcover himſelf ſo cleerly to all men: but he knew that I would not be contented with equivocations, nor enigmatique anſwers as many others, and that I was of a profeſſion to keep all ſecret.</p>
               <p>And notwithſtanding for all that, the ſame of that falſe revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion continueth yet at this day, and will continue from father to ſon, and thoſe that will come after us will write it as an Article of faith. And whatſoever they did talk of an infinite number of other miracles which were ſaid to be done in that Church, yet could I never learn ſo much as one; and when I have inquired, I found nothing but a falſe rumour of the people, nothing true; I mean true miracles, and not cures of Fevers, or the like accidents, which nature it ſelf with Gods concurring or aſſiſtance may do.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe many go thither thronging, as they do likewiſe in a number of ſuch places, on holy dayes and Sundayes, idle and working dayes; ſo that all the neighbouring Prieſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain as did that other, that their Churches were deſerted, that there is no body in their Temples to aſſiſt at the Divine Service, to hear the Sermons; but that under the falſe bruit of thoſe Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and under pretext of that indiſcreet devotion, the people do nothing but run up and down looſing their time and money, and bring themſelves in danger to ſtarve or ſteal, that they may live the reſt of the week, beſides a number of diſorders committed by the way, many young folks being glad of this occaſion to make acquaintance, men and women being often obliged to be pell mell
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:156624:56"/>
together, both by the way and in the Inne for want of roome, women return back with their purſes emptied, and their bellies filled with ſome other thing than wind; and all, they do there, is to hear a ſhort Maſſe in great confuſion, rub their beads againſt the Image, and receive in haſte ſome ſmall ſuffrages for their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and ſee and hear a great diſorder throughout the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the preſſe of the people; and thoſe who gain moſt there are the Prieſts and the Devils.</p>
               <p>As I remained in another Town bigger than the former, there was a child of twelve yeers of age, who had his ſinews ſo contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and drawn in, that he could not walk but crookedly, and lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his hands and knees, and was foure yeers in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, after which time a Gentlewoman of qualitie who had ſome skill in Phyſick, did undertake to cure him: and while he was in her hands for ſome weeks, his parents carried him to a famous Church, dedicated to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> where being come at the earneſt ſollicitation of his parents, he conſtrained himſelf to walk, and indeed did walk a little, and then did they cry out, a Miracle, beleeving their child was healed by a meer Miracle, which the honeſt Gentlewoman did contradict, maintaining that it was by her induſtrie and remedie: But ſhe was commanded by the Prieſts to keep ſilence, ſaying, that it was to deny the Virgin the glory due unto her, and that ſhe did not well; but becauſe the child did not walk firmly, but as if he were tottering, and very weakly, and as one whoſe ſinews were not as yet ſufficiently ſtrengthened, (as I did ſee with my eyes, and as it happened to thoſe who are cured by the Art of Phyſick,) it was a very ſtrong proof to all men of good underſtanding, that that cure had been done rather by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, than by miracles; which notwithſtanding was publiſhed in every place for moſt certain, and beleeved by thoſe who did not underſtand the circumſtances. I have heard ſpeaking, and had knowledge of a number of cures which the people did eſteeme Miracles, they being done beyond the hope of the Phyſitians, and the appearances of nature; but if all that falleth out ſo, ought to paſſe for a Miracle, there are an infinite number of the like done every day, both with and without prayers, both amongſt Chriſtians and Infidels; nature working often by wayes unknown to us, God permitting and ſo diſpoſing.</p>
               <p>But thoſe who are born blind, to recover ſight; and the dead to be raiſed, and ſuch like, is not done nor heard of now adayes; but
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:156624:56"/>
thoſe who come after us ſhall find enough wherewith to fill their books, as many Writers in our time, in the times paſt, and as they have done at all times in the Romiſh Church.</p>
               <p>And concerning the dead which are raiſed, I have but this one word to ſay; to wit, that there being hundreds, yea and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands who are ſaid in the Legends to have been reſuſcitated at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times, and by divers Saints, there is nothing ſeen nor found of all the ſaid dead, or written after they were raiſed; and I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell that men did not carefully gather all the news they might have brought from the other world where they had been, and how they did live after; For my part, if I knew a man who were raiſed 200. Leagues hence, I think I would willingly go thither to ſee him, and to learn ſomething from him of that which he had known and done from the time of his death, to his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and if a man ſhould carry him through the world as they do Monſters and rare things, I ſuppoſe he would gain more monies, than did ever any man hitherto with any other thing: But we muſt ſay either our forefathers have not bethought themſelves of that as now they might do, or rather they are but all fables: and except thoſe who have been raiſed by Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, and which are mentioned in the holy Scripture, I ſee not ſufficient ground to beleeve ſo much as one.</p>
               <p>And although there is no miracle now ſeen amongſt us; yet there is no famous Church wherein they do not often publiſh ſome; and there is no Religion and Order, that doth not daily repreſent to the people ſome new Images of Saints, who are or have lived (as they ſay) not long ago in their Monaſteries, and do many miracles; which in truth have never been done, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes are not miracles, but notwithſtanding ſhall be written for Miracles by the poſteritie.</p>
               <p>I being the laſt yeare in cloſe priſon above eleven moneths together, where I had no other company but two little tame doves, which ſeemed to be given to me of God for my conſolation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation in the affliction wherein I was for the confeſſion of his name and of the truth, and beſides ſome few Popiſh Bookes; there I chanced to reader (amongſt others) a certain <hi>Engliſh</hi> Authour called (as I remember) <hi>Ordericus Vitalis</hi> a benedictine Monke, who lived about S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Bernards</hi> time, a man zealous of the welfare and honour of his order, and writ the hiſtory of his owne age and the two precedings; there he makes mention of a multitude of able
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:156624:57"/>
men, and who were thought to be very holy in thoſe ages, and were afterwards canonized, eſpecially of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Bernard,</hi> whom he had ſeen and knowne, and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Anſelme</hi> Archb. of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who was dead a little before, and in whoſe Monaſtery he had lived, and of others the like: but he ſpeaketh not of one Miracle; which he would not queſtionleſſe have omitted, if he had knowne any; for it was his ſpeciall intent and inclination; and he complaineth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly and was ſorry he found none to write. Nevertheleſſe, thoſe who lived after, have been abler and ſharper-ſighted than he was; for they have diſcovered them by hundreds a far of, where he who was in the place and living at that time could not ſee nor finde one onely; ſo may we ſay of all the reſt, and although there be none in our time, yet they who ſhall come after us and write af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of the Romiſh Church, will finde a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
               <p>I have knowne a great many (of religious perſons eſpecially) who at this preſent have the opinion to be holy, and ſome of them to worke miracles, &amp; to have wrought in their life time; although I did never heare of it, ſo long as they were alive, and now they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to adore their Images; ſome of them indeed were men who lived without ſcandall, and in reputation of godlineſſe; but they were alſo ſaid to have their owne imperfections, as others; and I have knowne a multitude of ſecular perſons, whom I beleeve to have been no leſſe holy, &amp; more perfect than they. And I may bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirme, as having known it by long experience, and heard it an hundred times from the moſt judicious and beſt among the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, that if there be any vertue in the Romiſh Church, it is (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all compariſon) more among the Laicks and ſecular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, than in the religious orders and Cloyſters, for there is much hypocriſie among them, and more exteriour ſhew and appearance, to guide the opinion of men, and be eſteemed holy, than of interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and care to pleaſe and be agreeable to God, (God not bleſſing thoſe humane inventions.)</p>
               <p>And yet ſecular perſons do but ſeldome poſſeſſe that favour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the people, as to have Images, and be accounted holy and bleſſed, becauſe their parents finding not ſo great profit to make them paſſe for Saints, or bleſſed men, as doe the religious orders; they care not ſo much, for except (it may be) a little honour to their families, there is nothing but great charges and expences to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:156624:57"/>But there is no Saint nor miracle beleeved or eſteemed among the religious orders, which bringeth them not great profit, and abundance of Almes; becauſe they well know, that the more they are accounted holy, the more are the people inclined to doe them good, in hope of their prayers, and to participate of their merits, as they often tell them; and if there were no gaine to be made by expoſing of Saints and Miracles to the people, there would not be ſo many ſeen in the Romiſh Church, but the profit is worth the paines.</p>
               <p>And the better to colour their myſtery, they make Princes and Kings ſpeake as being intreſt in the glory of the Saint. Beſides, this being not done without great charges and much money, which they muſt give to the Popes Commiſſaries and Officers, they labour to ingage them, that they may have the helpe of their purſes. Thence cometh it to paſſe, that poore people who want competent meanes, or have not ſo eaſie acceſſe to great ones, as the religious orders, may never pretend to be adored for Saints, and canonized in the Church of Rome, whatſoever vertue or perfection they may have; but there be few of the moderne Saints, who are not of thoſe Orders, and there is no Order that hath not a great number, and expoſeth not every day new ones; for that trade is very profitable, and the invention gainfull.</p>
               <p>And if thoſe of the Romiſh Church brag ſo much of their Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which they ſay are ſo eaſily and often done, I marvell much they chaſe not the devills out of the bodies of a number of perſons, who (as they ſay) are ſo long time afflicted and poſſeſſed; that would be great charitie, and that onely were capable to canonize them during their life, and make them paſſe for Saints before the people, although it be eaſie to uſe impoſture therein; there (they ſay) hath been a great number in our dayes (whether by Sorcery or otherwiſe, I leave that to others) where the Romaniſts may have faire occaſion, for the fiction is eaſie there, and the devill doth his beſt to authoriſe the lye. Now I know that thoſe who are eſteemed moſt holy in the Romiſh Church, have been ſent thither even by the Princes command, and have tryed all their faith, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, faſtings, auſterities, reliques, bleſſed beads, prayers and exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſmes; yet there is none can ſay, they have been delivered by them.</p>
               <p>But I have ſeene that after a great many had been much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with a certaine Wench that was poſſeſſed (whom I knew)
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:156624:58"/>
to deliver her, at laſt a certaine Monke of a certain order, (whom I alſo knew) bethought himſelfe to take her in pilgrimage of ſeven or eight dayes Journey, to a certain Church, where many demoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acks were ſaid to have bin healed in old times; but he returned her with the Devill in her body, and a little Monk in her belly, which ſhee got of him by the way. I have knowne a multitude of ſuch like accidents, which I might ſet downe, but I chooſe rather to paſſe them over with ſilence.</p>
               <p>Now a thing which ſeemed moſt miraculous to me of all that I did ſee in the Romiſh Church, was certaine companies and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternities of people, who have not their name from any Saint, but from charitie, whoſe profeſſion is to bury the dead, yea even thoſe who dye of the Plague; and yet doe they not contract any evill themſelves, nor thoſe who frequent them: and I verily beleeve this cannot be done without ſome particular aſſiſtance and preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the bounty of God, that bleſſeth this good worke. But the Romiſh Church hath no reaſon to glorifie and prefer it ſelfe to others for it, becauſe that is alſo done in this Kingdome, and in the reformed Churches of other Kingdoms, even with a better ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe; for not onely they who have care of the body, but I have even ſeen thoſe who have onely a care of their ſoules, and who are ordained to miniſter ſpirituall comfort and aſſiſtance to them in their ſickneſſe, render them freely that ſervice, without catching any evill or danger, either for themſelves or thoſe who are conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with them; where of an hundred that I have ſeen imployed in that Charge in the Romiſh Church, I have not knowne ten that eſcaped, although they ever lived ſequeſtred from all converſation and commerce with the whole.</p>
               <p>But if we muſt acknowledge a Miracle, it is the delivery which it hath pleaſed God of his mercy to worke for me, not onely in bringing me out of the errour and abuſe wherein I was, but alſo out of ſtraight priſon, into which I was brought by the onely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidy and treaſon of my owne brethren; for, being detained there under five locked doores, ſome of them halfe a foot thicke, barred and boulted ſtrongly, all the windows grated after the ſame faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and watched ſo carefull, that I could neither write nor ſpeake to any, but to my Keeper, who was forbidden to have any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with me, except for neceſſary things, and was choſen to that from among five hundred for the great truſt they repoſed in him, but not ſo much as to entruſt him with the key of my inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:156624:58"/>
dore, which for greater ſecuritie was kept under two other locks, and given to another in cuſtody, who was commanded to carry them about him day and night, ſo that (to ſpeak in worldly appearance) there was no hope of my deliverance; but having called on God, and put my whole confidence in him, he moved the heart of my Keeper in ſuch manner, that he not onely reſolved to leave the errour of the Romiſh Church, after my example and perſwaſion, but even expoſing himſelfe to all danger, to ſet me at libertie, he had by Gods favour the induſtry to come by the key, which was ſo carefully locked up, without any noiſe, or appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of opening; and our good God gave us the grace to elude all their purſuing of us, (even with royall Authoritie) and to paſſe through the midſt of them that purſued us, and even among my own brethren without being perceived; and however, they thought they had ſtopped all the Ports and paſſages for us, nevertheleſſe, to eſcape by that onely which was moſt convenient and ready for us, and where (I may ſay) the onely providence of God towards us blinded them, they ſhould not miſtruſt, that he might ſave his poore ſervants, who had no other hope but in his bountie. And in this (doubtleſſe) we muſt confeſſe that God is marveilous in his wayes, and that there is even no wiſdome, councell, nor power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord; and if I muſt acknowledge any miracles, this may be ſaid to be one wrought by God towards me, rather than thoſe of the Romiſh Church.</p>
               <p>If we muſt acknowledge any miracles in our ages; the marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous deliverance of this Kingdom in the dayes of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in the yeer 1588, when the Pope having ſhared in half with the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> to make up that Navie, which they tearmed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible, to ſeize on this State, all their enterpriſes were brought to confuſion, without doing an exploit, and that more by ſtorms and Armes from Heaven, than by thoſe of men; this ſhould be called a Miracle. And the diſcoverie of that damnable Powder-plot to King <hi>James</hi> in his time, being the yeer 1605. wherein the Enemies of the truth thought to deſtroy all the glory and Nobles of this Kingdome in a moment; may be called a Miracle. And the victory obtained 1639, by the <hi>Hollanders</hi> againſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> on theſe Coaſts, where nine or ten ſmall Ships cauſed ſuch terrour and confuſion, and were the occaſion of the utter wine to a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and eſpouventable Navy, conſiſting at leaſt of threeſcore and ten ſaile of ſtrong Ships well armed; and brought all their unjuſt
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:156624:59"/>
deſignes to naught; this might be held a Miracle.</p>
               <p>And if we muſt acknowledge Miracles, the diſcovery of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy and confuſion projected the laſt Spring, the yeare 1641. againſt the tranquillity and repoſe of thoſe Kingdomes, ought to be holden for a Miracle.</p>
               <p>And the agreement ſo quickly made betwixt the two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> which the laſt yeare 1640. ſome helliſh firebrands and agents of the ſpirit of diſcord, would have ſet on fire the one againſt the other, to bring this whole State to confuſion and ruine, which God hath turned to the confuſion of the Authors, and good of his people; this may be ſaid to be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Miracle.</p>
               <p>And if we muſt cry out Miracles, that which is fallen out this preſent moneth of <hi>October</hi> (at the writing of this) in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where divers of the greateſt of the Nobility were neare to be maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, whereby the Enemies of peace thought yet againe to bring this State into confuſion, if God by his ordinary goodneſſe had not ſhewed himſelfe at this time againe the God and protectour of his people; ought to be eſteemed a Miracle.</p>
               <p>And if all miraculous deliverances which have been wrought by the bounty and mercy of God in this Iſland, ſince it received the faith and puritie of the Word of God, had falne out in <hi>Spaine,</hi> or in ſome other place under the Popes Juriſdiction, they would have eſteemed them as great Miracles as the deliverance of the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> out of the captivitie of Egypt under the leading of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or <hi>Joſuahs</hi> victories by his battels, or <hi>Sampſons</hi> with the Jaw-bone of an Aſſe over the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> or <hi>Davids</hi> over <hi>Goliah,</hi> or <hi>Judith</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Holophernes,</hi> and the like; and they would write and publiſh them as evident miracles. It is true alſo, and we ought to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Gods power doth clearly appeare therein; and we muſt not beleeve that thoſe deliverances are fallen out by accident &amp; chance, but confeſſe that the bountie of God would therein ſhew the care and affection he had for the conſervation &amp; protection of this his poore people, whom it ſeemeth he hath choſen and held in theſe ages for his peculiar heritage among all Kingdomes. And I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell the enemies of the truth and of this State, open not their eyes to ſee thoſe ſo marveilous protections, and that they have hardned themſelves ſo often againſt the manifeſt hand of God.</p>
               <p>But this ſufficeth, if thoſe of the Romiſh Church have no ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger proofes to maintaine their invocation of Saints, than the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:156624:59"/>
wherewith their Books are ſtuffed, that will ſerve to deceive the ſimple; but men of underſtanding wil not be ſatisfied with that; and I thinke it is out of queſtion better to addreſſe our ſelves to God through Jeſus Chriſt, who is our onely ſure Mediator, as he commandeth us, and as the Apoſtles have done themſelves and taught us to doe; than to interpoſe all the Saints, as the Romiſh Church telleth us, without any word of God, nay, contrary to the word of God, which condemneth with Anathema thoſe who ſhall preach to us or teach us any other wayes, beſides that which hath been preached to us by Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</p>

                  <hi>Let no man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thinke of himſelfe more highly than he ought to thinke, but to thinke ſoberly:</hi> And I have often marveiled that the Romiſh Church bragging that ſhee accompliſheth the Counſells of Chriſt, which ſhee holdeth for works of ſupererogation, and wherefore ſhee thinketh God much obliged to her, deſpiſe in the meane time the commandements of our Saviour, and alienate her ſelfe ſo far from his inſtitution and intention. For my part, I beleeve the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and perfection of a good Chriſtian, of perfect faith and of the true Church, doth conſiſt in approaching as neere as may be to the intention and inſtitution of Chriſt, and in indeavouring to do as he hath done, and as it hath been his will to ſhew us; and in ſo far as we can conforme our ſelves to his actions, eſpecially in the reception and adminiſtration of the Sacraments; for he is come to be our Maſter, and being the infallible Wiſdome, he hath done and taught us all was needfull.</p>
               <p>The Romiſh Church findeth fault with the Euchariſt, for being called the Sacrament of the Supper, and calleth it the Sacrament of the Altar. Now it is certaine that our Saviour inſtituted this Sacrament immediately after Supper, wherefore it may juſtly be called the Sacrament of the Supper, as it was for a long time in the Church of Rome: Even to this preſent they call it the day of its
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:156624:60"/>
inſtitution, the fifth <hi>feria</hi> in the Lords Supper, <hi>Feria quinta in coena Domini;</hi> and that notable Bull, wherein are excommunicated and delivered to the power of the Devill, all the Princes, Parliaments, and Courts of Juſtice, yea and the moſt part of Chriſtians in the world, and which is read ſo ſolemnly every yeare at <hi>Rome</hi> on thurſday of the holy weeke, is called the Bull in the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, <hi>Bulla in coena Domini;</hi> and when Chriſt inſtituted that holy Sacrament, it is certaine that was not on an Altar, but on the ſame Table whereon he had ſupped; and none of the Evangeliſts make mention here of an Altar; ſo there is no reaſon it ſhould be called the Sacrament of the Altar, but the Sacrament of the Supper, or if you will, of the Lords Table, or of the Communion, or of the Euchariſt; which words agree all with the inſtitution of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, but not that of the Altar.</p>
               <p>The greateſt controverſie in this myſtery, is not concerning the name, but the body of Chriſt, which the Romaniſts thinks they receive ſubſtantially and corporally there, and the Orthodox and reformed Church ſpiritually, ſacramentally, and figuratively, and after the ſame manner that our Saviour did receive it and give it to his Diſciples. Now there is no appearance our Saviour did eate his true and proper body; for ſo ſhould he have had his body within his body, his whole head in his mouth &amp; in his ſtomacke, and at one time been paſſible and impaſſible; neither is there any likelihood he gave it after that manner to his Diſciples; for as it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.63.</note> 
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.63. <hi>It is the ſpirit that quickneth, the fleſh profiteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;</hi> and although we know that the whole body and perſon of the Son of God, is of an infinite merit, becauſe of the hypoſtaticall union with the Deitie; yet the Romane Doctors confeſſe ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and affirme with us, that it is not the corporall reception, nor to receive it corporally, that quickneth and maketh us parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the graces of this holy Sacrament; for ſo ſhould rats and dogs be capable as we are; but onely the ſacramentall and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall union and reception, which is by true faith and the true and ſimple love of God, under the ſignes of this holy Sacrament; and therefore I marvell they ſtammer ſo much at this, ſeeing they doe not pretend to receive more ſpirituall graces and benefits therein than they of the reformed Churches doe.</p>
               <p>For my part, I may truly ſay in this as I have already ſaid in the matter of the Saints, my inclination is very forward to render to God and the Saints, and all the myſteries of our Religion, all
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:156624:60"/>
poſſible honour and reſpect; and if I could acknowledge the reall and corporall preſence of my Saviour in all his Sacraments and in all the myſteries of my Religion, I would do it with all my heart; but we have rules and lawes that guide us, and to which we ought to ſubmit our ſelves, and onely looke to the will of God, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and holy Word; for that is the onely meaſure which ought to rule and forme our faith.</p>
               <p>Now it is moſt evident by the Words and inſtitution of Chriſt, that he did not give his body corporally, but onely figuratively and ſpiritually under the ſubſtance and figure of bread; for ſee the words of <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.26. <hi>And Jeſus took bread, bleſſed it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 26.26.</note> 
                  <hi>and brake it, and gave it to his Diſciples:</hi> There yee ſee that which he tooke was nothing but bread, and that he bleſſed the bread, which he did take, and brake it, and gave it; ſo it was but bread which he gave, for that which he tooke, and bleſſed, and broke, was but bread.</p>
               <p>But yee object, that he ſaid,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.26.</note> 
                  <hi>This is my body</hi> therefore that which he gave was his body.</p>
               <p>It is true, he ſaid, <hi>This is my body;</hi> but it is to be remarked that our Saviour ſpeaking in Hebrew (which although much mingled with the Syriaque, was yet ſo called) ſpake according to the phraſe of that tongue; now in that language, the word, <hi>ſignifie</hi> or <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,</hi> is not found, and in place thereof they uſed the word, <hi>Eſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So we ſee in the Hebrew old Teſtament, this word, <hi>Eſt,</hi> ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily uſed for the word, <hi>ſignifie</hi> or <hi>repreſent,</hi> as, <hi>Gen.</hi> 40.12.<note place="margin">Gen. 40.12.</note>

               <p>It being impoſſible then for our Saviour to ſay in his own lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage this ſignifieth or repreſenteth my body, becauſe thoſe words were not in that language, he ſpake as he could, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the forme of ſpeech uſed among the Jews, and familiar in holy Scripture: And the Evangeliſts knowing that Chriſt did ſpeak in that manner, have ſet it down the moſt ingeniouſly they could: ſo the Romiſh Church hath no reaſon to beleeve that to be his true body, becauſe Chriſt ſaid, <hi>(This is my body.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 14.6.</note>Beſides, when our Saviour ſaith, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.6. <hi>I am the way, the truth, and the life, I am the doore,</hi> and the like; the Romiſh Church underſtandeth it figuratively, and by way of Allegory; why then when Chriſt hath ſaid <hi>(This is my body)</hi> do they not underſtand it figuratively? for it is as hard to beleeve that the bread is the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Chriſt, as that he is the way, or a doore; and all that they ſay, that our Saviour did more clearly explain himſelf in thoſe other paſſages than in this; it is without reaſon or ground, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he hath explained himſelf more cleerly in this than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,<note place="margin">Luk. 22.19. 1 Cor. 11.16.</note> ſaying, <hi>(Do this in remembrance of me)</hi> as S. <hi>Luke</hi> hath it 22.19. and as S. <hi>Paul</hi> explaineth it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.16.</p>
               <p>Moreover, if Chriſt had given his true body, he would have commanded his diſciples to adore it, and would have elevated it that they might have adored it; which cannot be obſerved, ſeeing they ſate ſtil at Table, which is a poſture no way fit for adoration: and they who ſhould do it now in the Romiſh Church, would be judged to be prophane and contemners of God; and this adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would have been chiefly neceſſarie at this firſt inſtitution: and as it was impoſſible but ſome crums would fall eſpecially in break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bread (as Chriſt is ſaid to have done) he would ſtraightly have charged them together to gather up all the crums together diligently, not leaving any, (as they do in the Romiſh Church;) for according to this opinion, Chriſt ſhould be wholly in everie little crumme, as well as in the greateſt pieces; which neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe is not to be ſeen in any place of the holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>This is alſo proved by the words pronounced in the diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the cup; for thus <hi>S. Matthew</hi> hath it, 26.27. <hi>(and taking the cup he gave thanks,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 26.27.</note> 
                  <hi>and gave it them, ſaying, Drink ye all of this, for this is the blood of the new Testament, which is ſhed for many for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:156624:61"/>S. <hi>Luke</hi> who hath written ſince hath theſe words, Chap. 22. <hi>v.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 22.20.</note> 20. <hi>This cup is the new Teſtament in my blood which is ſhed for you;</hi> and likewiſe S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. This might ſuffice to ſhew that the words of S. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſhould be figuratively underſtood, and in a ſignificative myſtery; for S. <hi>Paul</hi> and S. <hi>Luke</hi> having written ſince, have ſet it down after the ſame manner to cleer the myſtery; having made as it were a paraphraſe upon the words of Saint <hi>Matthew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now thoſe words of S. <hi>Luke</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> lead ſtraight to the knowledge of the truth; for I beleeve not they can ſay that the cup is really the new Teſtament, or a covenant; for a Teſtament or a Covenant are a relation, an action, an accident, and the blood is a ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>Moreover, a Teſtament conſiſteth in clauſes and promiſes, which can no wayes appertain to the blood of our Saviour; and there is no reaſon to call Chriſt the Teſtament, ſeeing he is the Teſtator himſelf; and if a partie contracting can be called Teſtament and Covenant, the faithfull may alſo be called the covenant; and the Prieſt making daily the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhould make the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and Teſtament of Chriſt every day, which is eternall, and was made before the inſtitution of this myſtery. The Goſpel which is the Teſtament of the Son of God being alreadie divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: and therefore we muſt ſay that thoſe words <hi>(this cup is the new Teſtament in my blood)</hi> ought to be underſtood figuratively, and in a ſignifying myſtery; and therefore you may ſee the word, <hi>eſt,</hi> uſed for ſignifie or repreſent even in the inſtitution of this myſtery by the Romaniſts own confeſſion; wherefore then think they it ſtrange that it is ſo uſed alſo in the diſtribution of the bread?</p>
               <p>Furthermore, this Sacrament is called bread in a number of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, and that after the inſtitution of this myſterie, and Chriſt ſaith after the adminiſtration of the wine: <hi>(Verily I ſay unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the Vine)</hi> he meant then that it was wine after he had ſpoken thoſe words.</p>
               <p>In a word, the inſtitution of Chriſt appeareth ſo clearly in this myſtery to have been onely the figure of his body and blood, that I marvell how any can doubt of it; and thoſe who deſire to be further informed upon this may read the Authors who have written of it more learnedly and copiouſly, eſpecially the books of Doctors <hi>Peter du Moulin,</hi> and <hi>Andrew Rivet,</hi> two of the moſt
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:156624:62"/>
able and famous writers of this age and who are reputed for ſuch even by the learnedſt of the Romiſh Church.</p>
               <p>Now as for the diſtribution and communion under two kinds, it is certain that Jeſus Chriſt gave it ſo, and that he gave the bread and wine together to all them that were then at Table with him: and that in them he hath commanded all Chriſtians to do the ſame,<note place="margin">Matth. 26.26.</note> by thoſe words, <hi>(Take and eat)</hi> and by thoſe other words, <hi>(Drink ye all of this)</hi> for they to whom he ſaith, <hi>Drink ye all,</hi> were none other but they to whom he had ſaid, <hi>Take and eat:</hi> and when he ſaid, <hi>drink ye all,</hi> if they to whom he ſpake ſhould onely repreſent the Prieſts (as the Romaniſts will have) there ſhould be none alſo but the Prieſts obliged to communicate under the element of bread; for they were none other but the ſame: and there is neither ground nor reaſon to make this diſtinction.</p>
               <p>But if they ſay that the Church hath taken the cup from the people for many juſt reaſons, and to ſhun a multitude of inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences; as becauſe the wine might eaſily ſpill, becauſe it is ſcarce in divers places, or for the irreverence many might commit in wetting their beards in the cup, and ſo letting ſome drops of the blood of Chriſt hang thereon, by which means they ſhould have the whole body of Chriſt hanging at their mouſtaches, which would be very great irreverence, and other the like frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and ridiculous reaſons, that is to ſhew themſelves wiſer than their Maſter Chriſt, and to blame him of indiſcretion, for not foreſeeing all thoſe inconveniences and diſorders in inſtituting that holy myſtery.</p>
               <p>But our Saviour being the eternall Wiſdom cannot be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of that vice, and well knowing and foreſeeing all that was to fall out in the world through all the ages to come, all thoſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ought not to be alledged on the contrarie: but it is in a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of other things as well as in this, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> paſſeth from the inſtitution of Chriſt to follow her own inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, deſiring her ſelf to be eſteemed wiſer than the Wiſedom it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Now I beleeve a Chriſtian cannot be blamed for doing as Chriſt our Maſter hath done, and taught us by his example and words, and to imitate him as neer as can be in all his actions, and eſpecially in the adminiſtration and reception of the Sacraments; but rather that the perfection of a Chriſtian life and doctrine conſiſteth in following the words, and examples, and the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:156624:62"/>
of Chriſt, and that with all poſſible exactneſſe; and ſeeing the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> beleeveth and confeſſeth that Chriſt hath inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the holy Sacrament as it ought to be, and none can find fault with his inſtitution; wherefore do they not follow his inſtitution and example? which if they did in this and other things, they would in a ſhort time be but one fold and one Shepheard, to wit, Jeſus Chriſt; and all controverſies ſhould be quickly decided.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Maſſe, and of Prayers in a ſtrange Tongue.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ONe of the things of greateſt importance at this day in the Romiſh Church, is the Maſſe which the people be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to hear wholly, on the Sundayes and holidayes, under the pain of eternall damnation, and are exhorted to hear it every day, for which ſo many rich Altars are erected; for which ſo great diverſity of ornaments of ſilke and embroiderie loaded with gold and pearl, and for which they have ſuch a huge number of uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils, of incenſe diſhes, of candleſticks, lamps, and moveables of gold and ſilver, that to ſpeak the truth, it is a thing very pleaſant to the eye, and very capable to draw approbation and applauſe from thoſe who have no other reaſon but ſence; but in matter of Sacraments and divine myſteries, men ought not to ſtay upon hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inventions proper for recreation and delight, as may be done in Tragedies and Comedies, and in worldly magnificences and pomps of this world; but they ought onely to look to the divine intention and inſtitution, and ſeek more after the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſalvation of the ſoul, than the contentment and pleaſure of the ſence.</p>
               <p>And howſoever the Popiſh Doctors preach to the ſimpler, that Chriſt and his Apoſtles did ſay Maſſe, and write in the Indexes of their Bibles, and contents of Chapters, the Maſſe proved in theſe places where Chriſt inſtituted the Sacrament of his Supper; if they mean that, to communicate in both kinds is to ſay and ſing the Maſſe; I confeſſe truly that Chriſt and his Apoſtles did ſing Maſſe, and that the faithfull communicating and perticipating of the Sacrament after this manner, ſay Maſſe.</p>
               <p>But if by the Maſſe they meane to make a ſacrifice upon an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:156624:63"/>
covered with three Table-clothes with ſo many prayers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after in a ſtrange tongue, and unknown to the people, with ſo many Ceremonies and lifting up of their hands and eyes, with ſtretching abroad and folding of their armes, fingers, hands, and body, with ſo many croſſings upward and downward, on the right hand and on the left; on the bread, the wine, the corporall, the Altar, the forehead, breaſt, and mouth of the Prieſt, and where the Prieſt communicateth ordinarily alone and almoſt everie day, and the people (for a long time) onely once a yeer; for my part after I had read again and again the holy Scriptures, I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver find any ſuch thing, or any thing like to it; and ſo, it muſt of neceſſitie be confeſſed to be a humane invention for the end which I ſhall quickly ſhew you, and no Divine inſtitution nor Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Neither can they in reaſon alledge here the Apoſtolicall Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and derived from Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles, although there is nothing expreſſed in the holy Scripture, nor any written word; for if that myſtery were of ſuch importance (as the Papiſts would have it at this day) it would have been ſo alſo in the time of the Apoſtles who ſhould have had a perfect knowledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it being a doctrine they ſhould have much preached to the people as a thing of exceeding great importance; and they being men of excellent devotion, and incomparable zeal for the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of faith, they ſhould every day, or at leaſt often, have ſaid Maſſe, and exhorted the people earneſtly to be preſent, and hear the ſame as they do in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> now there appeareth nothing at all of this in the holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> indeed ſpeaketh to us (eſpecially once) of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of the Supper, and of the preparations wherewith we ought to come to it. Furthermore we ſee that the Apoſtles and primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians did conveene ſometimes about Eaſter to break bread, and participate of that divine myſtery together, but in no other place is there any mention made of the maſſe in the Romiſh faſhion, nor of any ſacrifice without blood (as they tearme it) which I exhort all the Romaniſts diligently to conſider as I have done; and I perſwade my ſelf they will no more find it there, than I; Neither will they find any where, that the bread of the Supper was an hoaſt, or a round cake, or that they kept it in the Temples with ſo great ceremony and care in Tabernacles, and rich cabins, as they now do in the Romiſh Church; and I beleeve no other
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:156624:63"/>
thing can be concluded, but that the Romiſh Church thinketh her ſelf wiſer than Chriſt and his Apoſtles, in obtruding for an Article of faith a doctrine which was never left by Chriſt, and which was neither preached, written, nor practiſed by the Apoſtles; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they had ſpoken nothing in their Epiſtles, yet <hi>Luke</hi> who did write all that he could ſee and learn of their actions, would not have omitted this which is eſteemed of ſo great importance in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So it is clearly to be ſeen in the Hiſtories, that it is an invention of the Popes, who have from time to time added to it, every one of them according to his fancy, to day one ceremony and prayer, to morrow another; now one ornament and veſture, and then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; ſometimes making it of one faſhion, ſometimes of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till at laſt it was come to that height, wherein it is at this day in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> &amp; it is now a ſnare to precipitate ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Prieſts into the bottome of hell, for not uſing that diſpoſition which they know to be required therein; and which is the cauſe of the perdition of an infinite multitude of Chriſtians for not hearing it with that reſpect the Romiſh Church requireth, which they of that beliefe are obliged to obey, and in doing againſt their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience (although erroneous) they are judged culpable of ſin: and all that according to the doctrine and maximes of that Church.</p>
               <p>Now to define properly, or deſcribe the Maſſe as it is at this preſent, I ſuppoſe I may ſay juſtly that it is a good trade inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and invented by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to nouriſh and entertain an infinite number of Prieſts, who become Prieſts principally to gain their living thereby; fit to inrich the Monaſteries and Churches, and make all the Monks live finely, and whereby the peoples purſes are emptied, and finally a Trade that ſerveth to condemne many as well as thoſe who ſay it, as of thoſe who are obliged to hear it.</p>
               <p>This definition ſeemeth a little too rude, and at the firſt ſight ridiculous; but it is true, and the Romaniſts themſelves may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it; (if they will) for the taxes and priſes of Maſſes now adaies are for the moſt part as of bread in the Market, and he that giveth not ſo much, getteth none; and becauſe ſilver was ſcarcer in former times than now, ſo the Maſſes were not worth ſo much; and a Maſſe that will not be ſaid now for eight or ten pence, was not worth two or three pence in former times; and in many places men had more then they deſired at that rate, and becauſe all things
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:156624:64"/>
are dearer now than they were, ſo the maſſes are alſo.</p>
               <p>And becauſe the religious orders who are inſatiable in wealth, and who never refuſe any wealth whenſoever it cometh, were loaded with ſo many maſſes that they could not ſay the half of them: the Pope who ſaith he hath power in heaven and earth, hath (as they ſay) of many ſmals, made one great; and of an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of maſſes which were founded by particulars, he hath made but one, wherein all the benefactors are comprehended in groſſe and in generall termes; and ſo by an handſome Bull hath diſcharged them of all ſcruples, which if their founders had miſtruſted, they would have been wary to have left ſo great wealth and rents as they have done to that effect; ſo they who live at this preſent amongſt the Papiſts, are become wiſe at the coaſt of their Anceſtors, and are loath to commit any ſuch follies, and rob, and beggar their children to inrich and fatten the Monks.</p>
               <p>But howſoever, commonly he that wants money can have no maſſes; and becauſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holdeth maſſes to be the principall meanes to deliver a ſoul out of Purgatory, ſo there are none but poore people who are to ſtay a long time in that fire for want of money to buy maſſes as the richer ſort; and ſo to be rich is a great help in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to go ſpeedily to Paradiſe, contrary to that which Chriſt ſaid in S. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.25. that it was very hard for rich men to enter into heaven;<note place="margin">Matth. 10.25.</note> but it is a Church and Sect wherein the whole doctrine of Chriſt is over-turned.</p>
               <p>And as it is a very profitable profeſſion to ſay maſſe, ſo there is abundance that embrace it as a good Trade, and ſufficient to gain their living well; and they ſay no maſſe but when they find Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants; and if they can have every day, they account it great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit: and he who giveth moſt ſhall firſt have the Maſſe, for ſuch is the courſe of the market: I will not ſpeak of them who being but able to ſay one maſſe a day, do nevertheleſſe promiſe the ſame to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and take money for many; becauſe imagining it to be of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite merit (according to the doctrine of the Romiſh Church) they beleeve that one is capable, to ſatisfie for all, and is beyond compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of greater worth than that which is given by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> altogether; but this is a myſterie which muſt not be revealed to the people; for that is againſt their intent, and if they ſhould beleeve it, they will be loath to be ſo forward to cauſe ſay ſo many maſſes (either for themſelves or for their friends deceaſed, or who are in travelling, or in neceſſitie:) notwithſtanding this is but too much practiſed in
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:156624:64"/>
deceiving the ſimpler to the undoubted condemnation of many Prieſts, who ſo deceive the Merchants, who mind to deal honeſtly; though I will not ſay that is the practiſe of all.</p>
               <p>But that hindreth not this to be true, that the Maſſe is a Trade which condemneth many Prieſts as well in that reſpect, as becauſe they beleeve they receive a Sacrament and make a ſacrifice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the purity of the conſcience is declared to be altogether neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie according to the Romiſh doctrine, and to which they ſee themſelves ingaged every day to gain their living, or for other ends, it is altogether to be feared, that for the moſt part they go not about it with due puritie of conſcience; and daily experience ſheweth us ſufficiently that there are too many vices and defects in the Romiſh Clergie, not to have this diſtruſt.</p>
               <p>And it is in this manner I ſay, that the Maſſe is a trade that damneth many who ſay it, yea and many alſo who hear it; for all Chriſtians in the Romiſh Church being obliged, under the pain of mortall ſin, to hear the whole Maſſe, the Sabbaths and holy-dayes, and not onely to hear it, but to hear it with attention and devotion, without willing diſtractions, at leaſt which laſt any conſiderable time (as the third part of the maſſe, according to rules of their Caſuiſts and Doctors) this condition maketh me ſay, that of an hundred there are not ten (it may be) that fulfill this precept, and are not condemned in hearing the Maſſe, they committing mortall ſin for want of due attention; but let every one judge himſelf: it ſufficeth that I know but too well the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes of the Romiſh Church not to be beleeved in this point.</p>
               <p>And to ſpeak truly, it is a lamentable thing to ſee the Romiſh Church condemne and judge with damnation they who hear not thoſe myſteries with due attention and devotion, and in the mean time that the people ſhould carry ſo little reſpect to it; that I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelf all thoſe who have not ſeen would hardly beleeve it; for ye ſhall not enter into any pariſh Church, nor in a great number of others, where there are any conſiderable number of people, at a great Maſſe or often other wayes, but ye ſhall ſee ſome of them laugh, others prattle &amp; play the fool, ſome of them ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, others kneeling on one knee, others ſitting after an uncivill manner, and ſome ſeeking occaſions, if not with words, at leaſt with amorous looks; in one part the dogs play, in another chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren crying and weeping. In a word, often ſo great noiſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence, that it ſeemeth rather to be a market-place than a Church;

               <p>Now I having often times conſidered with my ſelf the cauſe of ſo great prophaneneſſe amongſt the people, and of the little at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and reſpect they carry to Divine Service in that Church; I beleeved that it did proceed eſpecially from the continuall pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in publique, in a ſtrange and unknown language to the people, and which very few underſtand; for howſoever I muſt confeſſe, that many of the prayers of the Romiſh Church are good, and all that they ſay is not evill and erroneous; Notwithſtanding they being ſaid in Latine, the people is not edified thereby, and not knowing that which is ſaid they can have no devotion, nor be ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up towards God, the Prieſts alſo ſinging often with their <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorian</hi> notes (as they tearme them) and even ordinarily ſing with ſuch haſte and anticipation one upon another, that even they who know the Latine, can underſtand nothing: and thence it is that not knowing what is ſaid and ſung by them, they can have no good motions thereby, and the people alſo for the moſt part read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely prayers and pſalms in Latine, it is not to be marvelled if they have not due attention, and if their minds which are not ſtayed by any ſenſible object of devotion, ſuffer themſelves to be carried away with a thouſand extravagant thoughts, and even often with actions.</p>
               <p>Which queſtionleſſe would neither come to paſſe in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, nor ſo eaſily, if their private and publique prayers were ſaid in a known language, as it was certainly practiſed by Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and even by the firſt Chriſtians; but the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> which eſteemeth more of his own proper inventions, than of the Word of God, and divine inſtitution, hath brought in an humane and new doctrine unto the people for the doctrine of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:156624:65"/>I know they alledge reaſon for it, and that they ſay (among others) that the myſteries ought not to be divulged to the ſimpler; and ſo the people in the Romiſh Church is nouriſhed in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great ignorance; and glory therein, the Doctors main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining them in it. But the Apoſtles and Chriſt did not ſo; and no man can be too much inſtructed or learned in the myſteries of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: and many moe miſchiefs follow on ignorance than on knowledge; and it is certain that Chriſt did pray, preach, and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate all myſteries in the vulgar tongue which was underſtood of all, and no man can doubt but the Apoſtles did the ſame: what then?

                  <p>Of Auricular Confeſſion.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THis point of Auricular Confeſſion is alſo for the preſent hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to be of greater importance in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> than the Maſſe, and there is no vertue nor any other duty ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended at this day as a full and faithfull confeſſion of all ſins, and even a generall confeſſion of the whole life. In a word, all the perfection and excellency of all Chriſtian doctrine at this day in the Romiſh Church aimeth at that point; and although ye ſhould give all your goods to the poore,<note place="margin">Concil. Trident. Tolet. Leſt. Bonac. <hi>and others.</hi>
                  </note> and were the beſt man in the world, and indued with all the excellent parts of bounty and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, yet if ye confeſſe not often, and exactly, all your ſins great and ſmall, all the adherent circumſtances which aggravate the ſame, and tell faithfully and punctually the number, all the reſt is nothing; and without that (ſay they) it is impoſſible to be ſaved, or pleaſe God in any faſhion, for thoſe who have the occaſion and commodity to do the ſame after they have ſinned.</p>
               <p>To prove this doctrine which is an Article of Faith in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they produce no paſſage of the Scripture that hath either force or reaſon: for, to alledge that of <hi>S. James,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iam. 5.16.</note> ch. 5.16. <hi>(Confeſſe your faults one to another, and pray one for another that ye may be healed)</hi> is without ſence or reaſon; becauſe that which
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:156624:66"/>
is ſubjoyned (and pray one for another) ſheweth clearly, that as S. <hi>James</hi> recommendeth not prayer onely to the Prieſts, ſo he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth none to confeſſe their faults to the Prieſts alone.</p>
               <p>For as he ſpeaketh of a reciprocall prayer and mutual aſſiſtance, ſo ſpeaketh he of a mutuall confeſſion betwixt particulars after quarrels and offences (as the Cardinall <hi>Caietan</hi> confeſſeth and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth well in his Commentary in this Epiſtle,) it is not there ſpoken (ſaith he) of a ſacramentall confeſſion, as appeareth, becauſe he ſaith, <hi>Confeſſe one to another.</hi> Now the ſacramentall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is not made one to another, but to the Prieſts onely; but it is ſpoken of the confeſſions, by which we mutually confeſſe our ſelves to be ſinners, that they may pray for us; and of the confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of faults which are done by one another to be mutually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed and reconciled; but there is no appearance that S. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaketh here of Auricular Confeſſion, neither of confeſſion to the Prieſts alone.</p>
               <p>And although it were true, that S. <hi>James</hi> did ſpeak here of the confeſſion to Prieſts, it will not follow that he ſpake of Auricular confeſſion, for there is great difference: and as it is very neceſſarie to ſalvation to confeſſe all our ſins to God, and profitable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe our ſins publiquely alſo, and before men in token of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and griefe, and to edifie our neighbours; ſo none can denie, that it is both profitable and good to confeſſe our ſins to the Prieſt, not for any obligation they have to do it (there being no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment or Word of God) but to diſcharge his conſcience, and ſeek remedie for his imperfections, conſolation in his infirmitie, and counſell in the ordering of his life.</p>
               <p>And howſoever the Prieſt may miniſter matter of comfort to a penitent and afflicted ſoul, upon the aſſurance he may give him that his ſins be forgiven him, if he be truly penitent, &amp; have a true faith in Chriſt; notwithſtanding he ought not preſume to give a formall abſolution, but onely declarative or elſe deprecative; nor think to pardon ſins as do the Prieſts of the Romiſh Church, there being none but God alone that can pardon ſins:<note place="margin">Mark 2.7.</note> as <hi>Mark.</hi> 2.7. but onely aſſure and declare thar if there be true faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, there ſins are remitted, or pray to God that he will remit them.</p>
               <p>And as for that which was ſaid to the Apoſtles by our Saviour, <hi>That whatſoever they ſhould bind on earth ſhould be bound in heaven; and whatſoever they ſhould looſe on earth, ſhould be looſed in heaven.</hi>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:156624:66"/>
It is clear from the conſideration of the whole paſſage, that it is onely underſtood of the exteriour power of excommunication, which we ought to acknowledge in the Church, not of the power to abſolve from interiour and ſecret ſins; for, ſee the paſſage, which I exhort the Reader diligently to conſider:<note place="margin">Mat. 18.15 &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>If thy brother treſpaſſe against thee, go and tell him his fault betwixt thee and him alone: if he ſhall hear thee, thou haſt gained thy brother. But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee two or three more, that out of the mouthes of two or three witneſſes every word may be eſtabliſhed: and if he ſhall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the Church; and if he neglect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as a heathen man and a Publican. Verily I ſay unto you, that whatſoever ye ſhall bind on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven: and whatſoever ye ſhall looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed in heaven.</hi> Thereby it is evident, that Chriſt meant onely to ſpeak of the band of excommunication and ejection out of the Church, and that all that the Apoſtles ſhould bind on earth with the bands of excommunication, ſhould be thought and eſteemed bound in heaven, and before God: and that which they ſhould looſe and abſolve on earth, reſtoring and reconciling them to the boſome of the Church, ſhould be holden abſolved and reſtored before God, and might partake in the prayers of the faithfull.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe, many Prieſts in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holding themſelves ſucceſſours of the Apoſtles in that, beleeve that from thoſe words they have power given them to abſolve from all ſins indifferently, without any reſervation, ſeeing that even the ſame words are ſaid to them, at their conſecration. But the Biſhops give their gloſſes and exceptions upon, and ſay that it is to them it belongeth, being properly and eſpecially the true ſucceſſours of the Apoſtles, and the Prieſts but by commiſſion, which they can amplifie and diminiſh at their pleaſure in the abſolution of ſin, limiting their power in certain cauſes, and reſerving others to themſelves, forbidding the Prieſts who are under their juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to abſolve them; and the Pope who tearmeth himſelf Biſhop of Biſhops, and attributeth the whole and abſolute power of the Church to himſelf, clippeth the authoritie of the Biſhops in this, uſing them as they uſe the Prieſts, forbidding they ſhould give ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution for every thing, but reſerve certain cauſes to himſelfe wherein he forbid them to meddle; and as the Prieſts murmure againſt the Biſhops for that, ſo do the Biſhops againſt the Pope, beleeving no ſin nor caſe whatſoever, to be exempted from their
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:156624:67"/>
juriſdiction according to the words of Chriſt: and thus do they agree among themſelves on the explication of thoſe words of God even in the matter of the Sacraments.</p>
               <p>But the Pope doth not onely extend thoſe words unto internall and externall ſins, but perſwading himſelf that it was eſpecially ſaid to him, <hi>All that thou ſhalt bind on earth, ſhall be bound in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: and all that thou ſhalt looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed.</hi> He taketh upon him to looſe the bands of oaths, looſe and exempt Subjects from the ſubjection and fidelity they owe to their natural Princes, and children from the obedience they owe to their fathers and mothers, when they become Religious in any Monaſterie; by the ſame authoritie they looſe marriage lawfully contracted, if it be found that the husband and the wife together have preſented a child to be baptized, or be allied by the confirmation; and ſo it ſeemeth that the Scripture is onely alledged by the Papiſts to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and maintain the power of the Pope.</p>
               <p>Now what ever is the controverſie among them for this paſſage, it ſufficeth that it manifeſtly appeareth through the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that Chriſt did never command Auricular Confeſſion, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and amendment, and that the Apoſtles did neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand nor practiſe it, which if they had done, it would queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe have been mentioned in the Scripture in ſome places of their writings, or in the Hiſtory of the Acts of the Apoſtles; and if the confeſſion were of ſuch importance as they would have it in the Romiſh Church, the Apoſtles doubtleſſe ſhould have preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and even practiſed it often amongſt them, confeſſing one to another; For all the Doctors confeſſe that they might commit, if not mortall, yet veniall ſins; and when they did declare the faith to the faithfull, they would alſo have preached the ſincere confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their ſins, and taught them the true manner of the ſame; and even to make generall confeſſions as they had preached the practiſe and exerciſe of other vertues; which not being found in any part, we muſt conclude, that in their time confeſſion was not in uſe, and that it is an humane invention, proceeding neither from Chriſt nor his Apoſtles, but inſtituted, eſtabliſhed, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Clergie for the great temporall profit they draw from it.</p>
               <p>I ſay moreover, in the time of the primitive Church, Auricular confeſſion was not in uſe, and was neither thought an obligation nor command, nor of ſuch importance as it is at this preſent;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:156624:67"/>
which that it may be moſt cleerly ſeen, I intreat the Reader, and (eſpecially them of the Romiſh Church) to ſee in the life of their Saints, which they hold for their Bible and holy Scripture; there let them read the life of all the Apoſtles and holy Martyrs, nay even of all thoſe whom they call the Confeſſors of the firſt ages, as of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Auguſtine, Chryſoſtome, Athanaſius,</hi> and <hi>Baſilius,</hi> who is eſteemed to be founder of the orientall Monks, of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Anthony,</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> the Hermits. Finally, of all thoſe of the fourth, fifth, and ſixth ages, yea and ſince, I am aſſured they will never find that any of thoſe ancient Fathers did make any auricular and ſecret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to the Prieſts. Notwithſtanding they are eſteemed to have been very zealous men in Chriſtian Religion, and men of vertue and exemplary perfection, who would never have omitted it, if it had been of ſo great importance. See both their life and death, there is never a word ſpoken of Auricular confeſſion; which if they had uſed, it would queſtionleſſe have been mentioned ſome where, in ſome one of thoſe lives, which are in great number.</p>
               <p>And he eſpecially who not long ago hath gathered and collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all thoſe lives; and who hath omitted nothing which he thought might be uſefull to the Romiſh Church, would never have left out this point, if he had found the leaſt traces of it in any places; and I even marvell he hath not added it, as he hath done many other things of his own invention; but we muſt ſay, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he did not bethink himſelf of it, or God hath not permitted it to confound this new doctrine of the Romiſh Church, by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ancient, and the practiſe of thoſe Fathers.</p>
               <p>And mark how the ſame Author forgetteth not to mention this point in the times of thoſe where he findeth it to have been uſed; and becauſe that this Auricular confeſſion hath been in greater eſtimation within this ſhort time than ever before, ſo there is no Saint in thoſe laſt ages in whoſe life there is not very ſpeciall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of their frequent confeſſions, and their ſincerity therein; but in the lives of the ancients there is no mention made of it at all.</p>
               <p>Moreover, I marvelled often that there was no more ſpoken of it in the books of the ancient Fathers; Turn over, I pray you, <hi>Auguſtine, Irenaeus, Theodoret, Chryſoſtome,</hi> and <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and ſee if there be any thing ſpoken of Auricular confeſſion to the Prieſts; it may be they ſpeak of ſome exomologeſe and confeſſion, but that was publike and not ſecret confeſſion to the Church for ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:156624:68"/>
and edification, and not ſecret and Auricular confeſſion to the Prieſts for ſacramentall Abſolution.</p>
               <p>Remarke alſo if yee finde in any place of them any examination of the conſcience, with which all the Books of this time are filled in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> ſee if any of them hath written any caſes of conſcience, to teach the manner of confeſſion, as we ſee a great multitude in our dayes; there yee will finde no ſuch things: and is it not a ſtrong proofe, if it be not found in thoſe Fathers, that Auricular confeſſion was not in uſe in thoſe dayes; for they being ſo godly men, and the moſt famous of their ages, they would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten queſtionleſſe have uſed it and recommended it to others; and it is not credible they would have compoſed ſo big volumes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making cleare mention in ſome place, nay, even in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of that which is eſteemed ſo neceſſary a Sacrament, and of ſo great importance.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, Yee will find in the Book of the lives of the Saints, and in the Hiſtory of the ancient Hermits, attributed to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> how thoſe Ancients were ſometimes, nay, even often and in many places of <hi>Aegypt</hi> foure or five thouſand Hermits or Ceno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites, or more, under one Superiour &amp; Maſter, accuſtoming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the ſinging of Pſalmes, reading and meditation of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture (for it was not as yet forbidden in thoſe times) and to work with their owne hands and bodyes to winne their livings, and be burdenſome to none (as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> did;) and commonly there was but one Prieſt for that great multitude, who often did not live amongſt them, but came to ſee them every Sabbath, to celebrate divine Service unto them.</p>
               <p>Now there is no appearance that the confeſſion was in uſe in thoſe times, for one or two Prieſts would not ſuffice to confeſſe often ſo great a number, and though a man ſhould doe no other thing in a fortnight, he were not able to confeſſe two thouſand: And thoſe Books of their lives make no mention that they called their Prieſts to confeſſe them, even when they were neere to death; but that they did prepare themſelves for that paſſage by the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and reading of the holy Scriptures, and often hearing and reciting of Pſalmes.</p>
               <p>And there were even many amongſt them, if that Author ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth truth, who were for ten or twelve yeares, or more, incloſed in little chambers of purpoſe, and ſequeſtred from all humane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, without ſeeing or ſpeaking to any, and often dying alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:156624:68"/>If in thoſe dayes the confeſſion had been holden for a neceſſary Sacrament, men would have judged that to be a diabolicall illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and deceit, as they would now doe in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> if there were any found, who to follow his private devotions ſhould leave off the whole way and practiſe of confeſſion. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat the Reader in the Romiſh Church, to conſider this well, and if he doubt I ſpeake not the truth, that he would take the paines to ſee thoſe Books, and ruminate the matter.</p>
               <p>Now all that ſheweth moſt cleerly, as I ſuppoſe, that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Auricular confeſſion, holden to be of ſo great importance at this day in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is not a doctrine derived from Jeſus Chriſt nor his Apoſtles, nor yet practiſed by them, nor uſed among the Saints and Chriſtians of the firſt ages, but a doctrine invented not long agoe by the Pope and the Clergie of <hi>Rome,</hi> for the great temporall profits it bringeth to the Prieſts; for, of all the Sacraments of the Church, there is none of ſo great worth to the Prieſts, as that of the confeſſion.</p>
               <p>And although there be ſome who take no money in confeſſing; that nevertheleſſe, is onely to refuſe a little fiſh for a big one, and the gratifications they receive from their penitents (eſpecially of the female ſex) recompence fully all their paines, thoſe who uſe that trade, and who are acquainted with their practiſes know well enough how profitable this myſtery is to the Prieſts; and it ſufficeth to tell you that a man who can but handſomely handle the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and the ſpirituall of men, can but eaſily diſpoſe of all their temporallities, and the gold and ſilver which is found with many confeſſours after their death, and the abundance of all things du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their life, and ſo many ſumptuous Monaſteries newly erected in many Cities, and ſo many coſtly ornaments, and ſo great riches and wealth, which are to be ſeene in many of them, are (for the moſt part) the effects of the ſole Auricular confeſſion, and it is thought that it is at this preſent, (at leaſt) as profitable to the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, as the doctrine of Purgatory or Invocation of Saints is or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was, this being even the <hi>Primum mobile,</hi> which moveth all the reſt.</p>
               <p>And they who doe profeſſe it, and know the worth of it, would not leave it off for any thing, and therefore labour to maintaine it by all meanes whatſoever; and that even in deſpite of the Biſhops, who would faine hinder the Fryars from uſing it, thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſufficient and capable enough alone with their Prieſts to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:156624:69"/>
their flocks, without thoſe auxiliary troopes which the Pope ſendeth them againſt their will, and which take all the fat and fleſh of the flocke, whereof Chriſt hath given them the full charge; but God ſo permit, that having left the true doctrine of Chriſt, they are confounded and troubled in the uſe and practiſe of their owne proper inventions.</p>
               <p>I remember that a man of great note amongſt the Clergy, told me ſome while agoe at <hi>London,</hi> that many of the Clergie in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> knowing the utilitie and profits the Confeſſion might bring them, were ſorry that morſell ſhould have eſcaped out of their hands, and that they would quickly ſet it up againe if it were in their power. I know not if he judged others by himſelfe or not, nevertheleſſe, I beleeved at that time with many he was not much inclined to Papiſtry, and now I have much reaſon to be otherwiſe conceited of him, and not I alone, but to ſatisfie ſuch men (if yet any ſuch be, which God forbid) I will tell them that as the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion bringeth great profit to ſome particular and private Prieſts, it draweth alſo after it inſupportable inconveniences and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities to the Paſtours and Generall of the Church, for, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is growne at this day to ſuch exceſſe in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by the perſwaſions and exhortations of the Preachers, that as the Paſtours in former times did move the people thereunto both by themſelves and others, they are now conſtrained to divert them at this preſent, becauſe where there is but a reaſonable number of people, this exerciſe is inconſiſtent with all other offices and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices in the Church, and it is impoſſible that the Prieſts and peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents can diſcharge themſelves faithfully, even according to the Rules of the Romiſh Church.</p>
               <p>For where there is (for example) 4000 Communicants in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh (as there are many if the moſt part) which will confeſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at ſome great feaſt, as at Chriſtmaſſe, or Whitſontide, or one of the feaſts of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> to which they have ſo much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted the people, that now it is become cuſtomary unto them; and he that doth it not, is in a manner not holden to be a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. Every Prieſt is not able to confeſſe fiftie in a morning, though he ſhould labour from five of the clocke in the morning till mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day without any intermiſſion; ſo that there muſt be above twenty Prieſts to confeſſe a thouſand in a forenoone, and above fortie for two thouſand, and yet all muſt be done poſt-haſt (as they ſay) and doe no other thing; and what good can one doe in ſo tickleſome
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:156624:69"/>
a buſineſſe in ſuch precipitation. In the meane time, who ſhall ſay all the Maſſes which muſt be ſaid aloud and with low voice, and who ſhall helpe to ſing and ſay the divine office, the Mattins and other Canonicall offices, as the cuſtome is in the Church of Rome, and who ſhall preach and perfect the reſt of the Service which the day and the publique require, and what ſhall be done where there are not ſo many Prieſts, two or three hundred being ſufficient to cauſe a great trouble.</p>
               <p>Beſides, when there is a great feaſt, the throng is ſo great al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in every place, that it will be one mornings worke onely to waite his turne, for to ſay two or three words in the Prieſts eare in great haſte; and that often putteth all the families to trouble and diſcord, for, the Miſtris is angry with the maide for ſtaying too long, and the husband againſt his wife; and if they be both there together, the children and the whole houſhold are in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</p>
               <p>Obſerve alſo that there are few others but women that will waite upon this weariſome and troubleſome devotion, for, the men, (eſpecially the wiſer ſort) not beleeving it ſo eaſily, and remarking ſo many things which offend their ſpirits, leave the practiſe to their wives, which being naturally inclined to prate and diſcharge their ſpleene, and diſcover their ſecrets, are glad of this occaſion to tell all their buſineſſes, and often thoſe of their neighbours, and declare their griefe to a man whom they thinke obliged to keep all ſecret; and therefore we muſt not marvell if we ſee the women ſo much inclined to it; and the Prieſts knowing them to be more tractable, and conſequently more liberall than men, labour to keepe them in thoſe exerciſes, what ever diſorders or diſcontentments may fall out from their husbands. But finally, there is no man of ſpirit who will not confeſſe that Chriſt and his Apoſtles have done wiſely, in having not inſtituted this fine my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie.</p>
               <p>The Biſhops alſo themſelves and other Paſtours, who have more intreſt to conſerve the divine ſervice in their Churches, and to have a care of the generall good, than of the profit and particular ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of their Prieſts, begin as much to deteſt the uſe of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, as they did ardently preach and recommend it heretofore, for now they ſee the great diſorders and inconveniences it draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after it, and their experience will be the cauſe they will not be ſorry to ſee all re-eſtabliſhed and reſtored to the primitive order in the time of our Saviour and his Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:156624:70"/>I paſſe over the great ſcandall occaſioned by this confeſſion, whereof an infinite number of Cities and places can give too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt teſtimony, and which is the cauſe many judge well that it is ſureſt and more profitable to diſcover and confeſſe our ſecrets to God alone, according to his holy will and commandements, than to Prieſts, to obey the precepts of the Pope; and I ſhall yet ſhew in another place, that the confeſsion is a ſnare which precipitates many into hell, if the Maximes of the Romiſh Church be true.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of Purgatorie.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which hath founded her new doctrine not upon the Word and will of Chriſt, but eſpecially upon profit and greatneſſe, hath not contented her ſelfe in ſtead of two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inſtituted by our Saviour, (to wit, Baptiſme and the Lords Supper) to adde five more, whereof the Pope, the Biſhops, and the Prieſts, can make good profit every one of them, according to his degree and charge; whether it be for the adminiſtration of them, or the diſpenſations, or other caſuall things, which concerne them, and which fall out every foot. But ſhee hath yet further bethought her, to invent a Purgatory, which ſhee ſaith is a place whether the ſoules of the faithfull departed in Gods favour doe ordinarily goe after their death, there to be burnt and tormented many yeares, nay, even many hundreds and thouſand yeares, if they be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by the good works of the living, or by the prayers of good people, or by application of the overplus of the merits of Chriſt and the Saints, whereof the Pope calleth himſelfe the ſole Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer and Diſpenſer, making profeſsion to apply them by his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biles and Indulgences.</p>
               <p>So that ſimple people to ſhun that terrible fire after their death, wherewith the juſteſt men are threatned, have often ſpoyled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their ſucceſſours of many lands and great riches, to give them to thoſe who are reputed to be godlier than others, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them to pray for them after their death, that they might not remaine ſo long in thoſe paines; and if thoſe who are alive have any affections to their parents and good friends which are dead, they often ſpare nothing to helpe and relieve them in this their
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:156624:70"/>
neceſsitie, by all the means which the Romiſh Church preacheth to be ſtrongeſt and of greateſt force, whereof the moſt part are in the hands and diſpoſition of the Clergie alone and the Monkes; and they tell them, if they be not helped, they muſt ſatisfie the rigour of the juſtice of God; and that they muſt pay to the laſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and be burned in a fire as hot and ſcorching as that of hell, not onely for the paines due to mortall ſins, but alſo for the leaſt veniall ſins they might have committed in their life, of which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man hath queſtionleſſe an innumerable number; and becauſe as they ſay, ready money is good phyſicke, they perſwade them not to truſt to their heires the payment of that debt, who may be diverted by the motive of avarice; but that they ſhould provide while they are alive and in health, for feare of being ſurpriſed by death; and that the candle that goeth before, giveth better light, and is more profitable; for, that is the phraſe of thoſe Ghoſt like Fathers.</p>
               <p>This doctrine is very profitable to the Clergie, but exceeding fearfull and very terrible and ſtrange, and deſerveth well to be cleerly grounded on the Word of God to be beleeved.</p>
               <p>For to ſay that God hath ſent his Sonne into the world to ſave mankinde, and whoſe bloud was of an infinite price; but neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, hath not been ſufficient to ſatisfie for the paines that a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſin doth merit, or yet a veniall, (that I may uſe the tearme of the Papiſts) or although it hath been ſufficient enough, and that he hath teſtified that he loveth mankinde, more than doth a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Mother their children. Notwithſtanding, he will not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to them a graine of his ſatisfaction <hi>gratis,</hi> but hath ordained a fearfull fire to burne them, and torment them after their death, though they be fully reconciled to him, and have departed in his favour; and that he eſteeme and call them his deere children; it is a thing that ought not to be beleeved by any Chriſtian, nor yet conceived by any man.</p>
               <p>And is it poſſible to be beleeved that God hath promiſed Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe to thoſe who ſhall ſuffer perſecution for his name and juſtice? and comfort them, who ſhall be afflicted in this world? and ſhew himſelfe to thoſe who ſhall be of a pure and cleane heart? account them bleſſed who ſhall dye in him, (that is to ſay, in his favour?) that Chriſt hath promiſed to ſay <hi>(Come yee bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world)</hi> to them, who have given meat and drinke to him in his poore
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:156624:71"/>
when they are hungry or thirſtie; and to them whom he accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his loving children; and that onely to ſatisfie the rigour of his juſtice, and without any hope of amendment, he will puniſh them after their death for many yeares, with the ſame paines that the Devill and the greateſt enemies of his honour and glory doe ſuffer, except onely that thoſe ſhall be tormented for ever, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhall have ſometime an end, it may be after many hundreds and thouſands of yeares; for they have invented yet of purpoſe more to terrifie the people, certaine Stories, which ſay that for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſmall ſin they muſt borne (at leaſt) ſeven yeares in Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and what can they hope for who have hundreds and millions, the frailty of man being but too great?</p>
               <p>It is queſtionleſſe to wrong the great mercy of God, and rather deny his bounty; it is to derogate from the infinite merits of the bloud of Chriſt; it is too blaſphemous againſt his Incarnation and paſsion; and the love that he hath teſtified unto us; it is willingly, and without grounds to make ſoules deſpaire, and terrifie the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences without ſubject, onely to bring profit to the Clergie; for, this is the meaning and ground of the myſtery.</p>
               <p>Now let us ſee if they have paſſages out of the holy Scripture, for a doctrine ſo cruell and contrary to the bounty and mercy of God, and merits of the blond of Jeſus Chriſt. They alledge this of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.14.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.14. <hi>If any mans worke abide which he hath built thereupon, he ſhall receive a reward; If any mans worke ſhall be burnt he ſhall ſuffer loſſe, but he himſelfe ſhall be ſaved, yet ſo as by fire;</hi> and that fire the Romiſh Church underſtandeth the Purgatory, and ſo concludeth that there is a Purgatory.</p>
               <p>I have granted that all which is in the holy Scripture, is not cleere nor eaſie to be underſtood, but onely that which is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſalvation; and this paſſage is one of the moſt obſcure and difficile in the Scripture; but not neceſſary to ſalvation; and yet the Romiſh Church will ground an Article of faith upon it, and the moſt ſtrange and terrible of all, and contrary to the bounty of God; but he who will reade the whole paſſage, will eaſily judge that it muſt be underſtood in an Allegoricall ſenſe, and eſpecially the word <hi>fire,</hi> which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> addeth on, <hi>as by fire,</hi> to ſhew that it muſt be underſtood by ſimilitude, ſaying, <hi>He ſhall be ſaved as by fire;</hi> that is to ſay, as if he had paſſed through the fire, or were purged and purified by the fire; even as we ſee the mettalls are purged by the fire and the Fornace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:156624:71"/>Now there is no reaſon for grounding this ſo important a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine (which is ſo ſtrange and difficile to be beleeved) on ſuch a doubtfull foundation; much leſſe on metaphoricall and allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and ſuch words; and it is evident from this paſſage, that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh nothing that commeth mere to the doctrine of Purgatory.</p>
               <p>But the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of Paſtors and Doctors, who in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing retaine the foundation which is Chriſt, on whom ſome build wholſome and ſolid doctrines, which in that place he tearmeth Gold, ſilver, and precious ſtones; others build light and vaine do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, called in that place, Wood, hay, and ſtubble; and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, that thoſe frivolous doctrines being tryed by the word of God, as mettalls by the fire, ſhall not ſubſiſt, and that the work of ſuch a Preacher ſhall periſh, and the tryall ſhall make it knowne that there is no ſoliditie; but as for the perſon of the Paſtour, he may be ſaved becauſe of the foundation Jeſus Chriſt, which he hath holden, being notwithſtanding tryed by the Word of God as by fire. So you ſee that it is there ſpoken of a tryall, which is made in this life, and not after death; and alſo of a tryall of the doctrine and beliefe of Paſtours by the holy Scriptures, and not of a tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of ſoules by fire; ſo they have no reaſon to ground Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on this.</p>
               <p>I know that this paſſage being obſcure and hard, hath many divers explications; but I beleeve every man of underſtanding will judge this the trueſt and moſt conformable to the intention of the writer, if he will but take the pains to conſider it; but howſoever, it being obſcure, we have no reaſon to beleeve that the Apoſtle hath preached an Article of faith to us therein; which is not to be found more cleerly explained in any other place of the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; and if becauſe there is mention made of fire in that place, the fire of Purgatory muſt be underſtood; they may produce an infinite number of paſſages where Purgatory may be found, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is mention made of fire in them.</p>
               <p>Take here another of as little ſtrength. Our Saviour ſpeaking in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.32. of ſins againſt the holy Spirit, ſaith,<note place="margin">Matth. 12.32.</note> 
                  <hi>He that ſhall blaſpheme againſt the holy Spirit, it ſhall neither be pardoned him in this life, nor in the life to come.</hi> This life to come (ſaith the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) is properly the fire of Purgatory, and ſo there is Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; but this doctrine doth not even agree with that they teach of their Purgatory, for they ſaid the ſins be forgiven before they
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:156624:72"/>
enter into Purgatory, and that none go thither who are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in favour with God; and ſo according to them, no ſin is pardoned in Purgatory.</p>
               <p>Now Chriſt by thoſe words, (which are alſo obſcure and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile to be underſtood) doth onely exagerate the ſin againſt the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, and ſaith, that he will not pardon it, neither in this world, nor at the day of judgement, where the ſecond condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is pronounced; and ſo that he will puniſh them in this world, and after death: but there is no man who ſeeth not that this is too far diſtant from the doctrine of Purgatory, to ground an Article of faith upon it.</p>
               <p>You ſee nevertheleſſe the cleereſt things which they produce, taken out of the Word of God to eſtabliſh the Purgatory, and that ſo terrible doctrine; where you may perceive the ſmall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and little probabilitie thereof.</p>
               <p>But behold here other far cleerer and manifeſt proofs drawn from the holy Scripture againſt Purgatory. Chriſt ſaid to the thiefe who implored his mercy, and put his truſt in him in the time of his death,<note place="margin">Luk. 23.43.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt be this day with me in Paradiſe:</hi> that is to ſay, thou ſhalt be this day happie with me. He ſendeth him not to Purgatory, although he had been a great ſinner all his life time, and that the death which he ſuffereth is by force, and by order of juſtice; and not for innocencie, or for the faith, as the Martyrs; and S. <hi>John</hi> ſaith in his firſt Epiſtle, 1. chap. 9. <hi>The blood of Jeſus Chriſt purgeth us from all ſins:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 1.9.</note> if all ſins be purged by the blood of Chriſt, there is no need of the fire of Purgatorie to purge them more.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 2.13.</note>And S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> 2.13. ſaith, that God forgiveth us all our offences freely; if God forgive us freely, as is evident thereby; he deſireth then no more any other ſatisfaction on our part, nor pretendeth to puniſh us in ſatisfaction to his juſtice.</p>
               <p>If a father correct his children, it is for their amendment, and not for his ſatisfaction; and can it be beleeved that God (who is ſo good and mercifull) doth puniſh his own with ſo cruell fires onely for his ſatisfaction, where there is no hopes of amendment? But if God afflict us in this world, it is for our amendment, and not to ſatisfie himſelf.<note place="margin">Heb. 1.3.</note> And in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Chriſt hath made the purgation of ſins, not out of all doubt by fire, nor by the tormenting of ſouls; but by his own precious blood which he hath ſhed for us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:156624:72"/>And in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> 8.1.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.1.</note> 
                  <hi>There is no condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them who are in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> If no condemnation, then there is neither eternall nor temporall fire: And our Saviour ſaith,<note place="margin">Ioh. 5.24.</note> 
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.29. <hi>He that heareth my word, and beleeveth in him that ſent me, hath eternall life, and ſhall not come into condemnation, but is paſſed from death to life.</hi> He ſaith not, from death to Purgatory; but to life eternall.</p>
               <p>You may ſee (as I ſuppoſe) the negative of Purgatory, which we are not obliged to do, more cleerly proved than its affirmative; which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould not maintain without evident Scripture: But this is not all, for you ſhall ſee more yet.</p>
               <p>In the book of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> 4.7. which they hold to be Canonicall,<note place="margin">Wiſ. 4.7.</note> 
                  <hi>Though the righteous be prevented with death, yet ſhall he be in reſt.</hi> He ſendeth not him to Purgatory, there to be puniſhed and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, as doth the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> that he may have occaſion to imploy his Indulgences, and the prayers of the Clergie.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Continue faithfull unto the end,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Revel. 2.10. &amp; 14.13.</note> 
                  <hi>and I will give thee the crown of life,</hi> And in the 14.13. <hi>Bleſſed are the dead which die in the Lord, from henceforth, yea (ſaith the Spirit) for they rest from their labours, and their works follow them.</hi> Is that to <hi>rest from their labours,</hi> to enter into flaming fire, which is of the ſame nature with that of the damned? Is that to reſt from their labours to be burnt for an hundred (or it may be) for a thouſand yeers? For if they be ſeven yeers for one mortall ſin (as they tearme it) they muſt be very juſt who are there for fewer than an hundred yeers; for there are but few which commit not many ſins in a yeer, and ſome men above five hundred; and if they die in the faith, and have repented, thoſe are they of which S. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaketh, ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed are the dead which die in the Lord;</hi> and therefore it is not true of them that they reſt from their labours, if they go to Purgatory; but rather that they enter into new labours and torments incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably greater and more inſupportable the leaſt quarter of an houre, than all the torments of this life: ſo to eſtabliſh and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Purgatory, they muſt renounce the holy Scriptures, and the Word of God.</p>
               <p>And in <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> which they hold alſo to be Canonicall,<note place="margin">Ecleſ. 22.11.</note> it is ſaid, 22.11. <hi>Make not much weeping for the dead, for he is at reſt. Seven dayes do men mourn for him that is dead.</hi> If he be in Purgatory, and in the fire and flames, is he in repoſe? and have not men reaſon to mourn and bewail them more than ſeven dayes?
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:156624:73"/>
Finally, if there is a Purgatory, all thoſe paſſages will be found falſe: but all thoſe paſſages being true, the doctrine of Purgatory is falſe and lying.</p>
               <p>And as for the eaſe which the ſouls in Purgatory are ſaid to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by the prayers ofthe living,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 9.5, 6.</note> it is ſaid in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> chap. 9.5, 6. <hi>The dead know not any thing, neither have they a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the Sun.</hi>

               <p>If they have no portion in the works of this age, then all the merits and prayers which are applyed to them by the Pope and his Clergie, and by men profit them nothing.</p>
               <p>Judge now (I beſeech you) if thoſe paſſages, and an infinite number of the like which I might alledge, are not cleer againſt the doctrine of Purgatory: and notwithſtanding of all that, they will eſtabliſh it in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> upon ſome very obſcure paſſages, labouring to ſtrike terrour in the hearts of the living, telling them that Chriſt hath not ſatisfied abundantly nor efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly; &amp; that his paſſion hath not been of vertue ſufficient to ſave us, which is properly to ſay, that it hath not had force and ſufficiency enough to redeeme us, and ſatisfie the wrath of his Father for our ſins; which is a doctrine repugnant to the infinite merits of Chriſt, and to the love which he hath carried to mankind, and to his word alſo; but moreover that we muſt ſatisfie by our own proper works and ſufferings, either in this or the other world, and do (ſay they) as S. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth us by thoſe words, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.24. <hi>I reioyce in my ſufferings for you,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Coloſ. 1.24.</note> 
                  <hi>and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Chriſt in my fleſh for his bodies ſake, which is the Church, whereof I am made a Miniſter.</hi> There do they conclude, that there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remaining beſides the paſſion of Chriſt, which we muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect our ſelves by our own ſufferings, and ſo that there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wanting in the paſſion of Chriſt, and ſome defect and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which we muſt accompliſh; for though they uſe not thoſe tearmes, yet that is the true ſence of their doctrine.</p>
               <p>But they ſhould conſider, that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth the over-plus of the afflictions of Chriſt, the tribulations and ſufferings of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, in which our Saviour ſuffereth yet every day as in his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, reputing their afflictions his, and of his own members; And in that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, that he ſuffered for the Church where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he was a Miniſter; it is not to ſay for her redemption, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, or ſatisfaction, but for her edification (as he ſaith in another place) that he <hi>indured all things for the elects ſake, that they
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:156624:73"/>
may alſo obtain the ſalvation which is in Chriſt with eternall glory:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.10.</note> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.10.</p>
               <p>Now we muſt not imagine there was any thing wanting to the paſſion of our Saviour, to ſatisfie abundantly and efficaciouſly for all men, and all their ſins to the juſtice of God his Father, or that all that we can contribute of ours, doth render it more perfect and powerfull; it is blaſphemie to beleeve it, and out of all doubt it is to wrong the infinite merits of the blood of the Son of God; One drop whereof was capable to redeeme perfectly an hundred thouſand worlds, if there were ſo many; and ſatisfie abundantly, and perfectly for all ſins, and the crime and puniſhment of them: and bleſſed is he who putteth his whole truſt and confidence in the paſſion of Chriſt; and on the contrary, he is accurſed from Gods own mouth, who putteth his confidence in man, and in his wayes and works; for he ſhall undoubtedly be confounded.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding of this, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſaith, that Chriſt by his death and paſſion hath not fully and perfectly ſatisfied for the ſins of men, but only for a part of them, the crime (to wit) and not for the puniſhment, and that we ought to make ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this life, or after our death in Purgatory, either by our ſelves, or by the ſatisfaction of good men who apply their good works to us: and becauſe Church-men did beleeve that they ſhould be eſteemed thoſe godly men, and that people would run to them rather than to others to beg their help, and ſo that it was an open gate to them, and an occaſion of great profit; this is the cauſe wherefore they have laboured to plant and defend this doctrine.</p>
               <p>Nor have they been deceived in their expectation, for Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans too lightly terrified with the pains wherewith the ſouls were menaced after death, have often deprived themſelves and their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours of the moſt part of their goods to give them to Monks and Prieſts, that ſo they might oblige them to pray for them, and apply their good works and ſatisfaction to them as well in their life time, as after their death.</p>
               <p>Thence have the foundations of thoſe great and rich Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries had their beginning, the revenues of which (ſome few except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) ſerve at this preſent to entertain Cardinals, Prelates, and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mens children in princely pomp and magnificence, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding think little on the ſouls of the poore founders, or their ſucceſſours, except often to torment and vex them.</p>
               <p>And on this doctrine, and by thoſe foundations ſuch a great
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:156624:74"/>
multitude of Prieſts, Monks, and religious perſons have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into the Romiſh Church, that it is almoſt incredible; ſo that in ſome cities which I know, there are above ten thouſand Monks and Nunnes; and as for Prieſts, there be many countrey Pariſhes which have above thirtie: Now except (it may be) two or three of that number, who are imployed in preaching, on whom good revenues were well beſtowed, to encourage and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them in their imployment in ſo Noble an exerciſe, if they did preach the Goſpel of Chriſt: the reſt commonly have no other occupation, but to ſing and ſay Maſſe for the ſubject of Purgatory; and by that invention eſpecially, they all live and are enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained fatly.</p>
               <p>For, the people affrighted with that terrible fire, cauſe often ſay Maſſes, Vigils, and Trentals; and found annuall Maſſes, and other Obiits for themſelves and their friends; and thoſe obiits may be ſaid with a loud or ſhrill voice, with great or ſmall noiſe accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the monies they will beſtow; and if it be at a great Maſſe, there muſt be ſo many coopes and coopers, ſo many lighted Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſo many Bels either tolling or ringing the knell ſo often, and ſo long at every time; there muſt alſo be ſo many Prieſts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to ſing and ſay ſo many Maſſes of ſuch a ſort, the Vigils, with ſo many Pſalms and Leſſons, with ſo many <hi>Requiems, Libera &amp; de profundis</hi> at the end, then the holy water ſprinkled, upon the Tombe, &amp;c. every one for his pains being to have ſo much, and a good dinner often for concluſion, where they drink to the health of the living, and ſay, God have the ſouls of the dead; and this is the end of the myſterie.</p>
               <p>That truly among its ſuperſtition maketh a great ſhew and noiſe; and if the ſouls be drawn out of Purgatory by magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, ſounding of bels, ſinging, and ceremonies; none but the ſouls of the poore will ſtay long in thoſe fires, and the rich will come quickly out; But if men beleeve they come not out, but by devotion and fervent prayers, and other good works of that kind; when I was in the Romiſh Church, I did not beleeve for a long time, that to be of great vertue and force, ſeeing the ſmall reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and devotion theſe Prieſts uſe for the moſt part, looking ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther how to disburthen themſelves quickly of that task, then to deliver the ſoul out of Purgatory; and I have often thought with my ſelf, that it was not without reaſon the Oblits laſted ſo many yeers, imagining indeed there behoved a great many of ſuch
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:156624:74"/>
prayers and works to deliver one ſoul out of Purgatory, if they cannot be delivered abut by works done in the favour and in the love of God, and in grace, (as they hold even in the Romiſh Church.)</p>
               <p>And it is no marvell, that they who leave the Word of God, to follow humane inventions, fall in thoſe confuſions and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders; But howſoever, the Prieſts find their profit thereon, and the peoples purſes are often emptied; divers having often ruined their children to make foundations after their death, and ſome, eſpecially women, incommodating often their families without their husbands knowledge, or even depriving themſelves of bread and other neceſſarie things, not ſo much for making little boyes recite the 7. Pſalms who give five or ſix paire of them for a pony; as to make the Prieſts ſay Maſſes and Obiits, which are not ſo cheap.</p>
               <p>Within theſe few ages, the Pope hath yet invented Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and priviledged Altars, which is another mean to draw pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit from them who are not ſo rich as to found ſo great Obiits, or who deſire to content themſelves with this new artifice, whereby they ſay a ſoul may be delivered out of Purgatory with leſſe coſt; and the profit thereof is both readier and frequenter on the Prieſts part; but I marvell much that the Pope who diſpenſeth thoſe Indulgences at his pleaſure, doth not deliver all the ſouls out of Purgatory ſo ſoon as they come thither, or doth not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from going thither; for the one is as eaſie as the other to him (as he ſaith himſelf,) and I marvell wherefore he ſuffereth them to burn ſo long in thoſe flames, ſeeing he can retire them without trouble or coſt, onely by his Indulgences; I think Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian charity ſhould require that of him: but let us a little exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the myſtery of thoſe Indulgences, whereof there is ſo great noiſe.</p>

to ſpend every day; a rent whereof many great Princes, who have more lands than he, come far ſhort; but beſides thoſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, viſible, and reall riches, he hath (ſaith he) others which he termeth ſpirituall, of which he is a more liberall diſpenſer than of the former; and thoſe are the merits and works of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erogation of the Saints, whereof he termeth himſelf Treaſurer and diſtributer, and which he diſperſeth according to his will and fancie, by that thing which he calleth Indulgences.</p>
               <p>For my particular, when I was in the Romiſh Church, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the ſix or ſeven laſt yeers, that I was the Popes Miſſionary, I was liberally enough provided of them both for my ſelf in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and to diſtribute to others; for, by vertue of my Buls, and quality of Miſſionary, beſides the Licence I had to abſolve from all ſins and caſes reſerved even in the Bull <hi>In coena Domini,</hi> where I might alſo admit as many Deputies as I would; I could give full Indulgence and remiſſion of all the puniſhment due to all ſins great and ſmall, to all them who confeſſed themſelves to me, and to all them who being confeſſed, and having communicated, were preſent at my Sermons on all the feaſts of our Saviour, and the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and others, ſo that they ſhould not go to Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory for their ſins paſt till that time, although they had lived fourſcore yeers. Moreover, in ſaying Maſſe I could deliver a ſoul out of Purgatory, perfectly every Monday in the yeer to my choice and will, beſides the Medails and Benedictions which I might have another way to diſtribute to whom I would. And I may truly ſay this of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. in this point, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>When I was a child, I ſpake as a child, I underſtood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For I confeſſe (to my confuſion now) that I was very ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious towards thoſe Indulgences, and did make uſe of them very often, as well for my ſelf as for others; and I did it ſo much the more willingly to others, that howſoever I took never any monies, nor made ever any temporall profit of them; Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, I did perceive it was a ſtrong mean to me to draw people af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me, and render them more affectionate to the doctrine which I would preach to them; and I know by long experience, there is almoſt nothing more efficacious to allure the people, eſpecially the ſimpler ſort, to do any thing they deſire, than the diſtribution of Indulgences.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:156624:76"/>And at what time the Popes did bethink themſelves to make the people beleeve that by thoſe Indulgences one might be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the fire of Purgatory, and free others alſo, they found that doctrine to be exceeding profitable, as well to fill their coffers with money at the Jubilees (which were termed the Popes harveſt) as to leavie ſtrong Armies of Souldiers to defend their eſtates and Territories, and make warre againſt their enemies.</p>
               <p>So that by the means of thoſe Indulgences they have often got many Millions, and leavied numberleſſe armies of Chriſtians, which they ſent out of their own countreys, to barbarous and remote countreys, where the moſt part loſt both their lives and eſtates; and that which in the beginning was onely done againſt the <hi>Turks</hi> as enemies of the Chriſtian faith, but eſpecially great enemies of the wealth and revenues of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who can pretend nothing where there is no Chriſtians; was afterwards practiſed even againſt Chriſtians for particular quarrels of the Pope, often injuſt and paſſionate.</p>
               <p>Now, for that myſtery of the Indulgences it is to ſeek the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe at noon day, to think to find them proved and authoriſed by the holy Scriptures; and I could never ſee any paſſage taken out of the old or new Teſtament that made any wayes for them.</p>
               <p>The onely place they think to be ſtrongeſt is that in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.18. which ſerveth to prove all things,<note place="margin">Matth. 18.18.</note> and on which the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Popes is eſpecially grounded, the words are; <hi>All that ye ſhall bind on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven, &amp;c.</hi> which they extend even to the things under the earth, to Purgatory (to wit) which they ſay is under the earth; But this paſſage hath been ſufficiently explained in the precedent Chapters of Auricular Confeſſion, and of the Primacie of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter,</hi> without ſtaying any more upon it, to which places I remit the Reader without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anſwer to ſhun prolixitie.</p>
               <p>Onely telling them here, that according to the letter of this paſſage (if it ſhould be underſtood as they will have it) the full power of Indulgences ſhould be given to all the Paſtors who call themſelves ſucceſſours of the Apoſtles in their office and miniſtry; but the Pope who cannot endure ſo many corrivals in his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, hath divided this power betwixt himſelf, the Cardinals, and the Biſhops, but very unequally.</p>
               <p>So that the Biſhops may give Indulgences but for fourty yeers,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:156624:77"/>
the Cardinals for an hundred, and he onely ample and full ones, and for all the time and yeers a ſoul muſt be in Purgatory for its ſin.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, they give them not continually full, but ſometime limiteth them to fourty yeers, ſometimes to an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and ſometimes to a thouſand; as in the Treaſure of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Francis</hi> girdle, there is an <hi>Item</hi> that hath; for every day from the nativity of our Lady there are 800. ſixtie, and two thouſand yeers, and an hundred dayes of Indulgences, and the remiſſion of the third part of them; this is certainly a long time, and behold a fair Indulgence; for, all the time from the creation of the world to this time is nothing in compariſon with this, it being not ſix thouſand yeers; and here above eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand; and yet this is not the greateſt, beſides the full ones; for ſometimes he gives Indulgence and pardon for eighteen or twenty thouſand, and ſome hundreds of yeers, and ſo many fourty and odde dayes; there wanteth nothing but ſome houres and minutes.</p>
               <p>This Theology is not to be found explained in S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> nor <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> nor others of the Ancients; for it was not in uſe then, yet many find, and large Commentaries are to be ſeen amongſt the Moderns to clear all the myſteries of thoſe thouſand yeers, fourty dayes, and the third part of ſins; but after reading them again, and again, and often times, I could never underſtand any thing in it, for the height and profoundneſſe of the matter.</p>
               <p>Now the thing that moved me to deſpiſe them, and maketh all men of underſtanding in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> vilifie them, is, that nothing of this is found taught by Chriſt, nor practiſed by his Apoſtles; and I marvell much (if it was of divine inſtitution) they did not uſe it to the weale and profit of poore Chriſtians, which lived in their time, and that they did not apply to them by Indulgences (beſides the merits of Chriſt) the merits of <hi>Moſes, Abel, Joſeph, Jacob,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> and of all juſt and holy men, to deliver them all quickly out of the fire of Purgatory, or hinder them from going thither; and that when they did preach, or paſſed through Cities, they gave them not (beſides their benedictions) a number of Indulgences, as the Pope and the Biſhops do now a dayes in viſiting their Churches; for they wanted not charity for the good and prompt happineſſe of Chriſtians; and we may well ſay (if that doctrine be true) that
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:156624:77"/>
the Chriſtians of our times are more beloved of God, and more fortunate, than were they of the Apoſtles times, and of the ages paſt; for, that Treaſure of Indulgences, whereof there was no mention made in their time, is very liberally opened at this day, and the Indulgences which at their firſt inſtitution were but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome given, and onely for fourty or few yeers, and at great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities, as at the conſecration of a Pope, or a Biſhop, at the dedication of ſome mother Church, or ſome like occaſion, are now almoſt ever given full, and that to them indifferently, who will honour the Pope ſo much as to ask them; they make alſo great catalogues and Items of all ſorts, either in favour of the canonization of ſome new Saint, or ſome Embaſſador, or Prince, or ſome ſuch like occaſion.</p>
               <p>And if a young Gentleman go to <hi>Rome,</hi> and have a deſire to bring ſome thing to his Countrey that coſteth not much, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may oblige his friends at his return, if after he hath kiſſed the Popes pantofle he ask him ſome Indulgences; he will give him ten or twenty thouſand without difficultie; for there needeth but a word, and an hundred thouſand doth coſt no more than two, neither in the giving nor in the carriage, if it were duckats he would not be ſo liberall: Now it may be he will ſay to him, I give you twenty thouſand benedictions of ſuch a Saint, or Prince; that is to ſay, the power to apply twenty thouſand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences of ſuch a Tenure to twenty thouſand beads, Medals, Images, or Croſſes, and the like, in ſuch ſort that he who ſhall have one of thoſe about him in ſaying ſome <hi>Pater</hi> or <hi>Ave,</hi> or uſing ſome ſuch devotion, may deliver himſelf when he will from all the time he ſhould be in Purgatory, from his birth even to that day, although he were an hundred yeers old, and can often deliver the ſouls of his friends which are in Purgatory, and do them that courteſie when they think leaſt of it; and the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man when he returneth will give one half of them (it may be) to his Miſtreſſe, to oblige her; and mark, that it often doth and may fall out, that he who can diſpoſe of ſo great and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a portion of the treaſure of the merits of Chriſt, and the holy Martyrs, and Confeſſors, to deliver himſelf and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers out of Purgatory when it pleaſeth him; is an Atheiſt, a blaſphemer, murtherer, and a man given to all vices, having neither God nor ſoul, and who beleeveth neither an heaven nor hell; nevertheleſſe (according to that good doctrine) it muſt
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:156624:78"/>
take effect and be of force, eſpecially in others; for ſuch is the will, diſpoſition, and reſolution of the holy Father the Pope, who can bind and looſe how and when he will, and diſpoſe of the merits of Chriſt Jeſus, and the Saints, as of the Cabage in his garden.</p>
               <p>God knoweth, and all men of any underſtanding in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I ſay nothing here but that which is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practiſed, and which ought to be beleeved of all good Papiſts who are the true children of the Pope; But if it be difficile to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve all this without the Word of God, let them remember themſelves, they ſhould have a blind faith, and not be ſo curious; nor to be diſciples of Chriſt, but to be diſciples of the Pope.</p>

               <p>BEcauſe the learnedſt and moſt judicious of the Romiſh Church confeſſe, that the profeſſion of the three Monaſticall and religious vows is not an inſtitution of Chriſt, there being no ſuch thing found in the holy Scripture, nor practiſed by the Apoſtles; but onely an humane invention, which had its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning many ages after; and which by the induſtrie and diligence of the Popes, who (for their particular profit) did take them (almoſt from the beginning) in their ſpeciall protection, have been augmented and maintained even to that degree, wherein we ſee it at this day; and becauſe all thoſe profeſſions have their ſtraighteſt obligation onely from the authoritie of the Pope, who diſpenſeth on it when and to whom he will; which ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, he beleeveth not himſelf there is any divine obligation, but onely humane; having proved ſufficiently in the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that this power of the Pope is void and uſurped, it is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after needleſſe to trouble our ſelves any more to ſhew the nullity and invaliditie of thoſe profeſſions to oblige any one whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: ſo we ſhall content our ſelves to ſhun prolixity with this foundation which we have laid for this point, and others the like; and onely ſay here, that as the Indulgences have ſerved in former times the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to inroll an infinite number of Souldiers under his Enſignes, to make war for the conſervation
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:156624:78"/>
and augmentation of his revenues and eſtate; they have been alſo very uſefull to gather a multitude of Chriſtians under a great number of fraternities, congregations, and other orders; which the Pope having inſtituted, and eſtabliſhed under the name, and at the inſtance of ſome particular perſons, eſpecially for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and augmentation of his power and authoritie in time of peace againſt his enemies and evill willers; hath ſhortly after fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and gratified them with an infinite number of Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, priviledges, and immunities, as well to unite them, and make them more affectionate to him, gratifying them with ſo many favours; as to allure to themſelves more people under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and pretext of the great number of pardons and graces both for themſelves and their friends: knowing that the greater and ſtronger thoſe companies ſhould be, the ſtronger ane ſurer ſhould be his partie.</p>
               <p>And howſoever the Popes in the beginning did favour ſome companies and orders more than others, either becauſe they were taken from amongſt them, or for particular affections, or other reſpects; Nevertheleſſe, they have been conſtrained in the end, to avoid jealouſie to make all common, and make a great Bull to that effect, which they have called the great Sea <hi>Mare magnum,</hi> in which they have ſwallowed up all thoſe favours and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and made them common to all the orders; ſo, for the preſent they are all omnipotent on earth in matter of exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, priviledges and Indulgences; and there is not almoſt a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Prieſt amongſt them who hath not greater power than the whole body of Biſhops together in that which concerneth their eſtate.</p>
               <p>Thoſe ſweet and forcible inticements of Indulgences and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges have much ſerved many Orders to allure an infinite mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of followers, and to win the affections of the people, and oblige them to give great Alms, and their means liberally, that they may partake of their favours and Indulgences: and the plentifull effects of this, are to be ſeen in many Monaſteries and Houſes ſo rickly founded, in Churches and Chappels ſo ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly builded, and enriched, and in an innumerable and inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable multitude of Monks, and religious perſons which live there, and are entertained in plentie, although at the coſt and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt generall complaint of all the Provinces republiques and Cities through the Chriſtian world where they are, and to the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:156624:79"/>
great diſcontentment of Biſhops, and prejudice even of ſecular Prieſts; both becauſe they run (as they ſay) on their Marches, and being companies furniſhed with all ſorts of ſpirits and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of holineſſe, know better how to ſnatch the ſubſtance of the people; and becauſe they are more prodigall of their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons often than they are deſired, they keep, by that means, the Prieſts and Paſtors in ignorance and negligence; there being few Prieſts and Paſtors (principally becauſe of that) in the Romiſh Church, who imploy themſelves in preaching as they ought; where we ſee in the places and kingdoms where thoſe orders, or rather diſorders are not, almoſt all the Miniſters give themſelves to that Noble and commendable exerciſe, and for the moſt part with great ſucceſſe.</p>
               <p>And for the great enterpriſes upon the rights of the Clergie, grounded (ſay they) on their Buls, there is at this day betwixt them, the Biſhops and Prieſts, ſuch a notable diſſention and ſtrange ſcandall in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they of that partie are aſhamed, and know not what to think on; and it is probable that ere it be long, the interchucks of thoſe great and heavie clouds will make terrible thundrings; I pray God the lightnings may be good, and the effects happie.</p>
               <p>But certainly it is not without ſubject, if the Biſhops complain ſo much, to ſee, the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> whom they eſteeme but their equall, under pretext of his uſurped authority, ſend them fellow-helpers in their Dioceſſes without their conſent, and even againſt their will and inclination, which (ſay they) have more power than themſelves, and brag they are exempted from their juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, preaching in their Dioceſſe againſt their will, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing in deſpight of them, and all the Paſtors; and who by their Indulgences and Papall priviledges, and other Monaſticall allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, withdraw their ſheep out of their Pariſh and common fold, cauſing ſchiſmes in their Churches, eſpecially by the means of certain congregations and brotherhoods, invented of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to bind the people to them, and draw from them their wealth and poſſeſſions, which is the drift and end of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery; and truly it would vex a Saint (as they ſay:) and if the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops power were anſwerable to their good will, there would in a ſhort time be no religious nor Monks in the world; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging at their own coſt too late that inſtitution never to have been of Chriſt nor his Apoſtles, but onely a humane invention
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:156624:79"/>
which the Popes have made uſe of, to maintain their authoritie amongſt the people, eſpecially againſt the contradictions of the Biſhops: and truly the Pope hath nor any ſtronger pillars at this preſent in the world; for he maintaineth them by priviledges and immunities, and they defend him by their tongue and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; ſo one hand ſcratcheth another.</p>
               <p>Now if the Biſhops complain ſo much, ſeeing their authoritie ſo far wronged in and by them; the kingdom republiques, and Cities do no leſſe at this preſent, finding their ſhoulders loaded, and their purſes extremely lightned thereby; for, the moſt part of them are open or ſecret beggars, who calling themſelves vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily poore, are ſhameleſſe, and beleeve mens whole eſtate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to them, and that every one is bound to give them; and who by their ſtratagems and importunitie can ſuck the very blood of families, leaving often nothing but the bones for the poore children to gnaw; for if you chaſe them out by the one dore, they will returne by the other; If they be refuſed by word, they enter againe by friends and other inventions; if you give them a flat deniall, they calumniate you amongſt your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours as an avaritious or ungodly man; if yee give to one, yee muſt give to twenty, nay, even to all, for feare of incurring their diſgrace and the bad effects of their tongues, which are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beleeved of the people when they lie, than others when they ſpeake truth, and are Trumpets that ſound every where; it is impoſſible to content them all, otherwiſe men muſt have the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Salomon.</hi> Moreover, they are inſatiable; ſo that an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man that would maintaine his family in any good faſhion and ſhew, that his children may obtaine better matches, if he cannot give thoſe men proportionably to that which they ſee appeare outwardly, he is often redacted to ſuch extremities, that makes him ſend a thouſand complaints and ſighes unto heaven, againſt the inſtitution and eſtabliſhment of thoſe kinde of men.</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible to hinder them when they have a minde to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle themſelves in any Citie or Biſhopricke, for being troopes compoſed of a number both of quick and dull ſpirits, they finde eaſily friends ſtrong and able enough to force and conſtraine the wills, even of Princes; and if Kings refuſe them, they ſet new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions and practices on foote, to move and ſtirre up Queenes to proſecute their deſignes; ſo that it is not to be marveiled if
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:156624:80"/>
they enter whereſoever they will, and there maintaine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the will and combination almoſt of all.</p>
               <p>And which is worſe, there is almoſt no religious Order, which hath not a deſire to multiply, inlarge, and eſtabliſh themſelves e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where, to poſſeſſe and governe all themſelves alone, and when they are eſtabliſhed, they move heaven and earth to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, leaſt any companions ſhould come and live neere them, or be admitted not onely where they remaine, but in all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and Sphere of their activitie. I know a certaine Order which being eſtabliſhed in a Towne, hath (to my knowledge) aſſayed all meanes for divers yeares, to hinder the Orders of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, Recolects, Penitents, Minims, Fathers Oratories, Feuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants, ſhod and bare-footed Carmelites, Pyramidall <hi>Auguſtines,</hi> and others, to ſettle neere them.</p>
               <p>Now if ſo much good commeth from thoſe Orders (as they make the people beleeve) I would gladly aske, wherefore they trouble and diſquiet themſelves ſo much to hinder others from being admitted and received with them, to contribute to the Common good, as they doe; conſidering the ſpirits and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the people to be different, and one will like one Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der who will diſlike another; ſeeing alſo (as they often preach) there cannot be too many good men in the world; but charitie (ſay they) beginneth at home, or to ſpeake the truth, covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe commandeth them as well as other paſſions, eſpecially va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and pride.</p>
               <p>I remember I have heard many great Preachers and Doctors, yea, even Prelates of eſpeciall learning and examplary life in the Romiſh Church, apply to them in their Sermons the words ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by our Saviour of the Phariſees and Scribes,<note place="margin">Mark. 12.38.</note>

               </p>
               <p>And many among them did confeſſe, the application was good enough for the moſt part, and they ſeemed to ſuffer it as perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Juſtice; notwithſtanding under-hand they left nothing unaſſayed whereby to be revenged and hinder them to preach any longer, for feare they ſhould reveale other things, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover more of their myſteries.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:156624:80"/>For my part, it is not my deſigne here or deſire to ſpeake any thing, either of particular perſons, or Congregations; although it may well be beleeved that if I would open my mouth, or move my pen, I know many ſingularities concerning the diſorders which have been committed, and which are committed there e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day to ſhame many; but as I pretend nothing but the weale and converſion of ſoules, not their confuſion; I deſire rather to bury all in ſilence than diſcover any thing, &amp; I will ſay no more of it, except ſome froward and impertinent ſpirit (as there are diverſe) will tax me of lying and impoſture in this Diſcourſe, and give me occaſion to explaine my ſelfe more cleerly, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce more evident examples and proofes to juſtifie my ſelfe of this crime; and ſo conſtraine my nature and inclination to doe that which I deſire not, and which queſtionleſſe will be diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to many.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of Juſtification.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Did imagine for a long time (as doe many of the Church of Rome at this preſent) that they of the Reformed Churches admitting Juſtification by faith alone, did it to exclude good works from the way of ſalvation, and ſhew themſelves in that
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:156624:81"/>
to be enemies of charitie, and of other vertues. I did therefore extreamly condemne them, and could in no wiſe approve of their doctrine; but when I came to ſound their beliefe, and ſee how they are not onely carefull to practiſe good workes and vertues, and that even much more than they of the Romiſh Church, and that they judged them neceſſary to ſalvation; and that the faith whereof they ſpeake, is not a dead faith (as the Papiſts underſtand it) but a lively faith, accompanied with good workes, and fruitfull in vertues. I acknowledged they wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully blamed them in this, as in many other things alſo, either maliciouſly to make them odious to the people, or ignorantly for not knowing their doctrine; as that they make God the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of ſin; and ſay, that Chriſt hath ſuffered all the very pangs of hell; and the like impertinent calumnies, which they never dreamed of, and which are very different from their beliefe.</p>
               <p>It is moſt certaine that the faith whereof Chriſt hath ſpoken ſo much to us, and which he deſired of thoſe whom he did convert to Chriſtianiſme, and called to be his followers, and of whom he ſaith,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.47.</note> that <hi>whoſoever ſhall beleeve in him, ſhall have eternall life;</hi> it is not that which is defined by the Romiſh Church to be a ſimple knowledge or beliefe, or a conſenting to all that God hath revealed to us; for, otherwiſe the Devills ſhould have faith and conſequently be ſaved. But true juſtifying faith is another thing; for it is not onely a ſimple knowledge and beliefe of God, and of all that he hath revealed, but it is further a firme beliefe in God; that is to ſay, a truſt in his promiſes, and a ſure know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his love towards us, as by his holy Word he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth himſelfe to be our Father and Saviour by the merits of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now this faith which worketh by knowledge and relyeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together on the promiſe of God, is neceſſarily fruitfull in good workes; for from the knowledge of the love which God bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth towards us, doth proceed our love towards him; and it is altogether impoſſible to truſt in the promiſe of God &amp; not loue him, and make good workes follow; thereby alſo is true faith diſcerned from a falſe, (to wit) if it worke by charitie, if it he joyned with a ſerious repentance, and bring peace of conſcience, if it be humble, not truſting in its owne merits, but upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God in Chriſt, if it kindle the zeale and love of God in our hearts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:156624:81"/>Such is the faith by which we are juſtified, that is to ſay, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved before God, and made pleaſing to him, thorough the righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt; and of which it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Joh. 6.47. Rom. 1.7.</note> 
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.47. <hi>He that beleeveth on him hath life eternall;</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.7. <hi>The Juſt ſhall live by faith:</hi> and this faith is not to be found in the Devils, nor in the damned (as the Church of Rome will have it.)</p>
               <p>This being laid downe for the definition of faith; it will not be hard to beleeve, that we are juſtified by faith &amp; not by works; ſeeing even the Apoſtle ſaith it ſo cleerly, that there is no truth ſo manifeſtly declared as this; and I thinke for my part, that he who will not beleeve it, muſt be extreamly blinded or obſtinate. Reade (I pray you) the third, fourth, and fift Chapters to the <hi>Romans,</hi> there you will finde how this doctrine is proved.</p>
               <p>He ſaith in the third Chap. verſ. 27. <hi>Where is boaſting then?</hi>

                  <hi>it is excluded, by what Law? Of works? Nay, but by the Law of faith, therefore we conclude that a man is juſtified by faith without the deeds of the Law.</hi> And verſ. 29.<note place="margin">Verſ. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>For it is God who ſhall juſtifie the Circumciſion by faith, and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion through faith.</hi>

Now it was not written for his ſake alone, but for us alſo to whom it ſhall be imputed, if wee beleeve in him that raiſed up Jeſus our Lord from the dead.</hi> And Chap. 5.1. <hi>Therefore being justified by faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 5.1.</note> 
                  <hi>wee have peace with God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And <hi>Gal.</hi> 2 16.<note place="margin">Gal. 2.16.</note> 
                  <hi>Knowing that a man is not juſtified by the workes of the Law, but by the faith of Chriſt, even wee have beleeved in Jeſus Chriſt, that wee might be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by the faith of Chriſt, and not by the works of the Law; for by the worke of the Law ſhall no fleſh be juſtified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To doubt, after all thoſe ſo cleare paſſages, that ſaith doth not juſtifie, and that we are not juſtified by faith, but by workes, is to be holden for incredulous and voide of ſence; for my part, after I had once conſidered and knowne the true definition of faith, and ſeriouſly examined thoſe paſſages, it was impoſſible to mee to doubt of ſo cleare a truth.</p>
               <p>True it is, if we doe no good but evill workes, we cannot be ſaved, yet if we be ſaved, it will not be for our good workes, but by the onely goodneſſe of God, and by faith and confidence in his love and promiſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:156624:82"/>I will illuſtrate it by this example: A King adopteth one of his Subjects freely to be heire of his Kingdoms &amp; enjoy his Crowne, providing he behave himſelfe honeſtly and not otherwiſe; if that man offend the King, he maketh himſelfe queſtionleſſe unworthy of the heritage and ſucceſſion, and there is no appearance he can poſſeſſe it; but if he behave himſelfe wiſely and doe well, ought he to thinke, it is his good deeds which have merited the crowne to him? No truly; for many would doe a great deale better, greater and more laudable actions, who will not therefore enjoy that poſſeſſion and heritage; but it is the onely goodneſſe of the King, which is the cauſe, and his onely voluntary and free adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which giveth him right to that ſucceſſion.</p>
               <p>So fareth it in this matter; By faith in Chriſt wee are adopted to be his children and heires of his glory, and as his adopted children we ought to ſtrive to pleaſe him in all things, and if we offend him and tranſgreſſe his commandements, and commit crimes againſt him, we make our ſelves unworthy of that heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and of his favours, and if we be not reconciled to him, we ſhall be deprived thereof and never poſſeſſe it.</p>
               <p>But if we be obedient to his Commandements, and do our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; thoſe are not nevertheleſſe our good workes and actions which merit that favour; for, many may doe the like works and actions, either of charitie, of almes, of juſtice, honour father and mother, or the like, who not being adopted by faith, ſhall not obtaine ſuch an heritage, nor the glory of God; ſo wee muſt not truſt to our workes and imagine they juſtifie and ſave us.</p>
               <p>And if it be ſometimes ſaid in the Scripture, that the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence followeth the workes, and if we doe well we ſhall have our reward, or the like; Wee muſt not thinke this recompence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the workes and is preciſely given for their merits, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the faith in Chriſt, and in his promiſes which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them, or rather which give them their excellence.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe that in former times, when I would make a ſerious reflex upon the workes which I did, which were eſteemed good and ranked amongſt the beſt in the eyes of the world, as faſtings, auſterities, mortification of the fleſh, ſuffering of cold, watching, and many ſuch things, which are common enough in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation where I was; when I had done all that I was able to make them perfect and meritorious, and when I joyned all the zeale, puritie, and love of God was poſſible, I did notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:156624:82"/>
ever finde ſo many inward defects and imperfections, that I could never perſwade my ſelfe they were of great efficacy before God to merit his favour or any heavenly recompences; they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict indeed and bring downe the body, and make it more able and apt to obey the Spirit (which was S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Pauls</hi> end;) and if they be not diſcreetly uſed, they bring men into many infirmities and diſeaſes; but that they might merit Gods favour or glory, or be capable to deliver a ſoule out of Purgatory, or ſatisfie for our ſins, I could never firmely beleeve any ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>And I know certainly from the knowledge which the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a multitude of ſoules hath taught me, this doctrine doth ſo little aſſure the conſciences, that there are none but fooles and preſumptuous perſons which thinke to merit Gods favour or heaven to themſelves or to others thereby. And all wiſe men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in this, that there is nothing but a quickning faith can ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie us before God; and howſoever the doctrine of the Church of Rome maketh faith to be onely the ground, and faith it is the love of God which juſtifieth, with the ground of faith, yet this love of God, well explained with the ground of faith, it ſeemeth to be no other thing than a quickning faith by charitie, and a beliefe and confidence in the merits of Chriſt and his promiſes; and ſo I thinke that the agreement would not be very hard to be made in this point.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe, the Romiſh Clergie, (principally the Fryars) making but little mention of faith, as if it were not of ſo great importance, preach nothing but workes, and eſpecially of the body, as faſting, mortification of the fleſh, diſciplines, haire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloaths, and the like, and chiefly Almes; and it ſeemeth even in hearing them, that the doctrine of good works is all brought to this head, and they doe it purpoſely: and all that (ſay they) is comprehended under the word <hi>Penitence,</hi> which <hi>John</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt did preach in the Wilderneſſe, though he underſtood a repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from ſin and amendment of life. And becauſe by Almes men deprive themſelves of ſome commodities, that is alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by them under the word <hi>Penitence,</hi> and they know well enough how to illuſtrate this doctrine by other paſſages out of Scripture.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the heavineſſe of the yoke of the Church of Rome, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the yoke of Chriſt.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS the compariſon which I made of the doctrine of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church with that of our Saviour Chriſt, made me ſee ſo great a difference therein, that I judged with great reaſon it was not the ſame doctrine, but another invented by men; ſo have I oftentimes compared the yoke of <hi>Rome</hi> with that of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Matth. 11.30.</note> and found his to be light and eaſie (as he ſaith) <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.30. and the Romiſh cruell, and inſupportable, inſtituted ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the deſtruction and death of ſouls, than for their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and profit, as I ſhall eaſily make it appear by the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods Commandments with thoſe of that Church.</p>
               <p>It is known to every one, that God was content onely to give us ten commandments by his Prophet <hi>Moſes,</hi> which Chriſt hath recommended unto us, aſſuring us that if we ſhall keep them, we ſhall enter into life eternall; <hi>(If thou wilt enter into life, keep the Commandments)</hi> ſaith he to the young man in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: and truly howſoever we are conceived in iniquitie, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally inclined to do evil, yet there is none of how little breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoever, who will not judge the commandment of God light and eaſie to be obeyed by the aſſurance of his holy Spirit, which is never deficient to the faithfull; for they are onely grounded
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:156624:84"/>
upon thoſe two commandments of love, to wit, to love God and our neighbour, which are commandments ſweet and eaſie to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie good nature and ſoul that is deſirous of its ſalvation: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the moſt part are onely negative, that we may abſtain from doing evill, as not to adore falſe gods, not to ſweare, not to kill, not to ſteal, and the like, which ſeem not to be ſo hard to every good and honeſt nature.</p>
               <p>And although all our actions be corrupt and imperfect, and we cannot do any thing here perfectly, and without fault; yet I doubt not but there are many faithfull who keep the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God ſufficiently, to hope for eternall life by faith in the blood and merits of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But the Paſtors of the Romiſh Church, or rather the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> going beyond the Commandments of God by his tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is not content with the ten Commandments of God; but attributing to himſelf the authority and power of God over man, he hath impoſed ſix or ſeven more commandments upon them, (beſides the ten) which are for the moſt part poſitive; and ſeem indeed to be but ſeven, but contain above three hundred, which every Chriſtian is obliged to accompliſh every yeer under pain of eternall damnation, if he be in the belief of the Romiſh Church; and the moſt part of them are ſo difficult for moſt men to accompliſh, that they may rather be ſaid to be gives and ſnares to caſt ſouls into perdition, than a furtherance and help to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as I ſhall clearly ſhew in the manner following.)</p>
               <p>As the Doctors in the Romiſh Church (diſdaining to uſe the termes of the holy Scripture) have ſummed up the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments in <hi>French</hi> Rhime, and ſo read them to the people; they have done alſo with the commandments of their Church, and ſay them publikely after this manner.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>The Church commandeth every one to ſanctifie the holy dayes,</l>
                  <l>On every Sabbath hear the Maſſe they muſt, and one the Feaſts likewiſe.</l>
                  <l>All Lent, foure times, and Saints Eves for to faſt,</l>
                  <l>And no fleſh Saterdayes nor Fridayes feaſts:</l>
                  <l>Thy ſoule ſincerely once a yeer confeſſe,</l>
                  <l>Thy Maker humbly alſo take at Paſſe,</l>
                  <l>Pay all the tithes and duties to the Church.</l>
               </q>
               <p>I remember when I was a little child, they taught us onely ſix, and I have ſeen for a long time the Commandments of the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:156624:84"/>
Church but ſix in number; but within this little time, that of Tithes is crept into the books, and is read at this day with their other Commandments, as of equall obligation with the reſt, which is obligation of damnation, and eternall death, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their common doctrine; for, they teach, and all their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors and Canoniſts hold, that thoſe commandments of the Church are of the obligation of mortall ſin, as well as the ten Commandments of God, although there be no mention made thereof in the holy Scripture, which is properly to go beyond the Commandments of God with the traditions of men.</p>
               <p>And however they ſeem to be but ſeven commandments, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they will be found to be about 300. or more, which every Chriſtian is obliged to accompliſh every yeer under pain of eternall damnation, (except in caſe of manifeſt neceſſitie,) ſo there is few dayes in the yeer, wherein there are not ſome one or more to obſerve beſides the obligations we owe to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God.</p>
               <p>This may be cleerly proved after this manner; for the firſt Commandment which obligeth men to ſanctifie all the feaſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, that is to ſay, that all the holy dayes which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Romiſh Church be obſerved and kept, as the Sondayes, and that the people work none of them, nor do any handie nor ſervile work; there being above 50. Holidayes every yeer, beſides the Sondayes; behold alreadie fifty more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments to be obſerved every yeer by every faithfull perſon.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Commandment, is to hear the Maſſe the holy dayes and Sondayes; here it is to be noted, that it is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to be idle, and abſtain from all labour and handy works, as well the Sabbaths as all the fiftie holidaies; Neither is it ſufficient to give themſelves to prayer, to read and hear the Sermon, or be imployed in any pious exerciſe; but moreover they muſt hear the Maſſe with attention and reverence; ſo that there being everie yeer above an hundred Sondayes and holidayes, there are alſo above an hundred obligations and commandments under pain of ſin and damnation to every Chriſtian every yeer; ſo there is above 150. every yeer.</p>
               <p>The third commandment is to faſt all the Vigils, the foure times, and all Lent; where ye are to obſerve, that there are twelve dayes in the foure times, and at leaſt as many vigils, which make 24. dayes, with fourty in Lent, which make above three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:156624:85"/>
and they are obliged every day to faſt under pain of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſin, and there be very few, (as all the Caſuiſts affirm) who are juſtly exempted; for from the age of 21. till threeſcore, all thoſe who are able to faſt without great &amp; manifeſt prejudice of their health, ought to do it; ſo that thoſe are 60 new command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which joyned to the former, make alreadie above 200.</p>
               <p>Moreover, he muſt abſtain all the faſting dayes from fleſh, under pain of mortall ſin, (that is to ſay, neither eat fleſh, eggs, nor butter, (according to the Statute) and ſome one will eaſily faſt, who cannot ſo eaſily keep this abſtinence; ſo there are 60. more commandments from this, which being joyned with the former, (beſides Gods ten Commandments) make above two hundred and fourſcore commandments of the Church, which every faithfull perſon ought to obſerve every yeer; and are onely comprehended in the firſt commandments; beſides thoſe of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſtinence every Friday and Saterday, and others which we might find in them that reſt, in the laſt of which onely which is to pay the tithes and dues to the Church, a great number might be remarked, and ſo we ſhould have above 300.</p>
               <p>Now God having given us onely ten Commandments, the moſt part whereof are negatives; and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing above 300. whereof the moſt part are affirmative, and without holy Scripture, of her own authoritie and particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, may we not ſay firſt, that ſhe goes beyond the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God by her traditions; and next that the yoke of Chriſt is light and eaſie, and the Romiſh yoke heavie and inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable; and if the authoritie of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be true, ſome men might be ſaved if there were no more but the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, which will be condemned for not doing thoſe of the Church; and an infinite multitude might fulfill the commandments of God ſufficiently to be ſaved, which muſt be damned; becauſe they have not faſted, or do not faſt all Lent over, and other faſting dayes, or who have not heard the Maſſe all the Sondayes and holidayes, or who have wrought or cauſed their ſervants work on them.</p>
               <p>I leave off to ſpeak here of an infinite multitude of other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of that Church, which are not common to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but to the Prieſts alone, and thoſe who are in Orders, and poſſeſſe Benefices; as every day to ſay their <hi>Brevier</hi> which is very long and weariſome; as alſo of all other precepts and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:156624:85"/>
particular to every religious Order, which truly make a great multitude of poore ſouls groane and lament, who out of ſimplicitie and ignorance have unhappily ſuffered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be oppreſſed under the weight of their burthens. But I will let them groane ſo long as they will, if knowing their error and abuſe (as do the moſt part) they will not take a neceſſarie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to break all thoſe humane bonds wherewith they are detained in that captivity, and follow after the doctrine of Chriſt, whoſe yoke is eaſie, and burthen light.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>If one can be ſaved in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT is certain that no man can be ſaved but by the faith which Chriſt did declare, and the Apoſtles hold and preach, which is the onely true and perfect faith, without which none can hope for ſalvation; Now I having ſhewed clearly (as ye have ſeen) that the faith of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is another different from that of Chriſt and his Apoſtles; the conſequence is eaſie to be drawn.</p>
               <p>But as I remember never to have hindred thoſe of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Religion, ſo much to become docile to the doctrine I prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to them when I was in darkneſſe, as when (according to the maximes of the Romiſh Church) I preached to them that they would all be damned without remiſſion; ſo that I may not alienate the ſpirits of thoſe of the Romiſh Religion from the reading of this diſcourſe, and leſt that thinking me too ſevere, they relliſh not ſo well the reaſons which they might read in this Treatiſe, I choſe rather to let them draw the concluſions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and remit the decree to Gods judgement, to whom onely it appertaineth to pronounce the ſentence of the ſalvation and condemnation of ſouls.</p>
               <p>But the thing I eſpecially intend in this Chapter, is, to ſhew to thoſe of the Romiſh Church, that even according to their proper maximes and doctrine, it is impoſſible for them (ſpeaking morally) to be ſaved: I know this propoſition will ſeem a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox to many, but if they will onely take the pains to ſee and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the reaſons on which I am grounded, I perſwade my ſelf
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:156624:86"/>
that even the moſt learned will confeſſe, and acknowledge it with me; for they cannot deny it, it being the common doctrine of their own Schools and books, which queſtionleſſe a multitude of ſimple people have never been aware of.</p>
               <p>I will not ſpeak here of the difficultie they of the Romiſh Church may meet withall (as do other Chriſtians) in the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods ten Commandments; for howſoever I know cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, and may ſpeak it truly, that they are worſe kept and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in that Church than in the Reformed Religion in <hi>England,</hi> or other places which I have ſeen; yet I will leave this point and compariſon till the following chapter, and will ſhew this impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilitie of ſalvation onely by the commandments which are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Romiſh Church, or rather by the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> to the ten Commandments of God; and I ſhall ſhew it eſpecially in the obligation of hearing Maſſes on Sundayes and holidaies, and in the conditions of the myſtery of confeſſion; for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that according to the maximes of their Doctors, the obligation to faſt all Lent over, and at other dayes commanded, ought to damne and deſtroy many, who otherwaies (it may be) are perſons unblameable, walking ſtraightly in the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Gods ten Commandments, yea, and in many other things: but having too much a do to faſt, do it not, although they might do it if they would but endeavour to do the ſame, and be not of the number of them whom the Lawes of faſting exempted.</p>
               <p>And howſoever alſo the obligation to keep the holidaies ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without working, or cauſing others to work, ſhould condemne (according to their doctrine) another great multitude, by whom this rigid and ſtraight commandment is hard to be kept for the great charge and imployment of their calling; yet that is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in compariſon of the difficultie that is in the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of hearing the Maſſe, which obligeth all Chriſtians, and the ſaying over of the <hi>Breviary,</hi> (which obligeth the Prieſts) and the obligation of Auricular confeſſion (which is common to all.)</p>
               <p>Becauſe ye muſt know according to the Doctors and Caſuiſts of the Romiſh Church, that for accompliſhing the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of hearing the Maſſe, it is not ſufficient to be there bodily preſent, but to fulfill the precept, one muſt be preſent in attention and devotion, ſo that he who is diſtracted, and thinketh or
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:156624:86"/>
dreameth on any other thing than on God, either by expreſſe or ſecret conſent, (that is to ſay) doth not all he is able to give attention, and baniſheth not faithfully all thoughts, but is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted for a conſiderable time during the Maſſe, which is thought to be about the fourth part of it, or almoſt the third part, that man heareth not the Maſſe, but is obliged to hear ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſame day attentively, if he will fulfill the precept.</p>
               <p>Now let every man judge in himſelf, how few there are which fulfill this precept in hearing the Maſſe without diſtraction or wandring minds, and which labour to diſcharge themſelves, and vaniſh them when they come with fidelitie: and we ſee but few who go to hear a ſecond Maſſe, as beleeving they have not heard the firſt devoutly enough.</p>
               <p>Some may ſay all this is but a little ſcruple, and of no great importance, but according to all the Caſuiſts and Doctors of the Romiſh Church, the obligation to hear the Maſſe with the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid attention and devotion every holiday and Sunday, is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of mortall ſin and eternall damnation: ſo it is of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and cannot be ſaid to be a ſcruple; and I have known ſome timorous people, which terrified with that rigid doctrine, did often hear three or foure, and after all, were little better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and did beleeve that point alone capable to deſtroy them, though otherwayes people of good life.</p>
               <p>That which is ſaid of the Maſſe in regard of all Chriſtians, is ſaid likewiſe of the <hi>Breviary</hi> and canonicall houres in reſpect of the Clergie; for they are obliged by the Popes Bull, and by his Councels, under pain of mortall ſin and eternall damnation, to recite them every day devoutly and with attention: and the longer thoſe prayers are, the more hard alſo is the obſervation of this precept, and I have ſeen ſome diſtracted thereby, and others to fulfill faithfully that commandment, and ſet their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences at quiet, tell one Pſalme or verſe ten times over, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not to have had ſufficient attention, and after all that, were yet in doubt; and of this number were even many Theologians and good Preachers. Finally, this ſheweth clearly enough, that if the Romiſh doctrine be true, it is impoſſible even to the moſt zealous, to ſave themſelves by this point.</p>
               <p>Now let us ſee the myſtery of Auricular confeſſion; the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie is yet greater here, for, the rules and conditions of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion are (according to all their Doctors) that when one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:156624:87"/>
himſelf,<note place="margin">Navar. Tolet. Bonac. Leſſ. &amp; alii Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiſt.</note> he is obliged firſt to declare all his publique and ſecret ſins, all his vitious actions, words and thoughts, and the circumſtances aggravating the ſin, and even the number of every ſort, whether be action, word, or thought. As for example, how many times one hath ſworn, and how many times he hath had bad thoughts, of what ſort, and how long he did delight and take pleaſure in every one.</p>
               <p>And that they may declare all, they are ſtrictly obliged to uſe all morall diligence to remember them, and this moral diligence is taken according to the intervalles of confeſſions, and the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of every ones memory; ſo that he who confeſſeth often, and hath a good memory, needeth not ſo much time as another who confeſſeth but ſeldome, and hath not ſo good a memory; and every one muſt imploy ſo much time, and take ſo much pains to examine himſelf before hand, as is requiſite to remember all, and omit nothing.</p>
               <p>And although (according to the generall precept of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church) one is bound onely to confeſſe himſelf once a yeer, yet if in going but once they do not remember all, they muſt go oftner, and ſo often as is neceſſarie to every one that he omit none of his ſins; and ſo every one almoſt will find himſelf obliged to go to confeſſion every week, and even oftner: and if he cannot remember them at the time of confeſſion but by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, he is obliged to write them. In a word, they are obliged under pain of damnation, to uſe all means and times poſſible and convenient that they forget nothing.</p>
               <p>And if for want of time or care, or ſufficient and due prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they leave off any thing of importance, whether it be acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, word, thought, circumſtance or number; the confeſſion is invalid and void, for it wanteth fidelitie and integritie, which is one of the neceſſary conditions, and according to all thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, they who receive a Sacrament without neceſſarie diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions commit ſacriledge; and if through baſhfulneſſe and ſhame (which is incident to women) any thing be omitted, the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is alſo of no force: now to what rack and torture is a poore ſoul redacted by the means of this confeſſion according to the maximes of the Romiſh Church; and to how many is this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, (which they preach ſo neceſſary to ſalvation, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, ſay they, none can be ſaved,) cauſe of ſcandall and ſtumbling block to make them fall headlong into hell? and who
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:156624:87"/>
following that can be ſaved in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> if this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine be found to be as true before God, as it is preached and written before men?</p>
               <p>It is not yet ſufficient, though they have fidelitie to merit abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and make a good and ſufficient confeſſion; there muſt (ſay they) be further in confeſſing a conſtant reſolution of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of that which is confeſſed, and all meanes and morall diligences are to be uſed for effecting it: as (for example) he who confeſſeth he hath not faſted all Lent, cannot have abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and is uncapable of it, if he have not a firme reſolution in time to come to faſt all the faſting dayes, and all Lent over, and uſe all poſſible meanes to effect it; and he that confeſſeth he hath ſworne or been angry, had taken a ſurfet, or ſold or taken more than is reaſonable, &amp; committed injuſtice, or had evill thoughts, (as of impuritie, revenge, or the like) is uncapable of abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and committeth ſacriledge in receiving it, if he have not a conſtant reſolution to commit thoſe things no more, and to uſe all poſſible meanes to ſhunne all thoſe things, and the occaſions of them.</p>
               <p>Oh! how pernicious is yet the confeſſion to many in that; for, when men fall continually in the ſame vice, and ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged often to confeſſe the ſame ſinne, it is a great ſigne they have little care to amend, and that ſo, they have but few conſtant purpoſes and reſolutions that are firme at their confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but every one ought to judge himſelfe, and though they can deceive men, it is impoſſible to deceive God.</p>
               <p>Now, who with all thoſe burdens, ſtrait obligations, and hard commandements, &amp; with that ſo ſtrange doctrine of the Romiſh Church, can hope for ſalvation, and eſcape damnation? Let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of that ſect make reflection upon himſelfe, and examine himſelfe in this point; I leave to every particular man to judge; and proteſt I have ſpoken nothing here, but according to the common doctrine of all the Caſuiſts &amp; Doctors of that Church, which is taught in the Schooles, preached in the Pulpits, and publiſhed in all the Bookes which handle this matter; and I know that no man of learning dare deny it.</p>
               <p>Oh! how ſweet is the yoke of Chriſt in reſpect of that of the Romiſh Church? and how it is more eaſie and ſure for to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, to follow the doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, than in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the doctrines &amp; inventions of men?

               <argument>
                  <p>A Compariſon of the Proteſtant and Reformed Church, with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in which of them two, is Salvation moſt certaine.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Have often marveiled, that the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe doctrine is ſo far different from the doctrine of Chriſt, and which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth leſſe of the Word of God, than any other ſect that is, or hath ever been amongſt Chriſtians; which preferreth her tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and inventions to the holy Scripture, and followeth the inſtitution of the Sonne of God ſo little in all his Sacraments; which imitateth ſo little the life &amp; order eſtabliſhed and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Apoſtles, in her Prelats and Diſcipline: in a word, which is ſo corrupted and vitiated as well both in doctrine and diſcipline, and where Gods Commandements are ſo little ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, his Sacraments ſo much prophaned, the Sabbath ſo little ſanctified; where prophane vices and abhominations raigne ſo much, and where diſorders and corruptions are to be ſeen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in every place, and in all ſorts of perſons, that neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, it is ſhee (amongſt all others) condemneth more freely and quickly others, and which braggeth ſhee onely is in the way of ſalvation; and all others are damned that conſent not to her beliefe.</p>
               <p>And upon this doctrine which the Pope cauſeth his followers preach and maintaine, to retaine and draw to him the people by feare, being neither able to doe it by Scripture, nor reaſon; are builded and publiſhed ſtrange concluſions, extreamly dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and pernicious to all other States but his owne; and that by the Jeſuits and a number of other Doctors of his faction; to wit, that all they of all other ſects, (except their own) whom they terme all hereticks, are worthy of death, and their Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors alſo; that it is a ſacrifice to God to exterminate them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by fire or ſword, or any other meane whatſoever; that they are not obliged to keepe promiſe with them in any thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:156624:88"/>
they being unworthy and uncapable of it; That a Prince of a contrary Religion to theirs, being an hereticke (as they terme him) is conſequently excommunicated by the Pope, who pretendeth to have authoritie over him as a Chriſtian, and that after the Excommunication thundred out againſt him, he is but a Tyrant and Uſurper, and falne from all rights, and uncapable of the Crowne, &amp; that no Chriſtians ſhould hold him for King, nor are obliged to obey him; that it is great pitty they ſhould be ſuffered to live and poſſeſſe the earth, which ſhould be onely for them and thoſe of their beliefe: and a number of the like ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous doctrines, which are written eſpecially by <hi>Becanus, Maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Suarez, Bellarmine,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Parſonius</hi> an Engliſh Jeſuit and Rector of the Engliſh Colledge at <hi>Rome,</hi> wrote a Booke in the Reigne of that vertuous Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which went ſecretly up and downe this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, wherein he laboureth to maintaine, that thoſe many hundred years the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have not been lawfull Kings, both for having (ſaith he) being criminall of <hi>Leze Ma<hi rend="sup">ty</hi>,</hi> or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherited, or baſtards, or for being hereticks, and ſo excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated by the Popes, and fallen from their right; and that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> (to wit, <hi>James</hi> of thrice worthy memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) nor his poſteritie, nor any other of his beliefe could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, nor ought to be admitted to that ſucceſſion, nor yet the Earles of <hi>Hertford, Darby, Haſtings,</hi> and others, who were next; and indeavoureth to prove, that it did appertaine by right to the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> as heire of <hi>Portugall.</hi> And upon thoſe imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent propoſitions and other imaginary pretences, the Pope was reſolved to ſeize upon <hi>England,</hi> and ſuppoſing the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and his ſiſter would finde too great reſiſtance, he had intention to ſend his Coſen the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> a great friend of his See, who being deſcended from <hi>Portugall</hi> by his Mother, pretended ſome right to it, or elſe the Cardinall <hi>Pharneſius</hi> the Dukes yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger brother, and procure him to mary the Lady <hi>Arabella,</hi> if need were, to accommodate the buſines; and to that effect, many ſtrange practiſes and factions were at worke, as well within as without <hi>England</hi> by the Papiſts of the Iſland, which may be ſeene more at large in a Letter that famous and learned Cardinall <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauld d' Oſſat</hi> writ from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Henry</hi> the 4. King of <hi>France,</hi> dated the 22 of <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1601. and is the 191 Epiſtle of his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Booke; there he mocketh all thoſe fantaſticke deſignes,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:156624:89"/>
and writeth beſides to the King his Maſter, that the Pope know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his inclination to aſſiſt the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> in purſuing his juſt title, would labour to divert him ſo far as he could, and make him favour his deſignes and many other things of this State, which are in thoſe curious Letters, and ſhew the great inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Pope hath for <hi>England,</hi> not (as they ſay) <hi>Propter Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum ſed propter Lazarum</hi>) not for the love of Chriſt, but for the love of himſelfe.</p>
               <p>And howſoever thoſe practiſes and maximes, and the like dangerous and pernicious opinions, relliſh not, nor are appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the more judicious and noble ſpirits of that partie, who well ſee all to be but a Papall invention, to multiply his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, and conſequently to augment his revenues and tributes; for there are no States of his beliefe, out of which he draweth not profit; and where he hath no ſubjects, there is nothing for him; yet they are but too much followed by multitudes of that ſect; and the attempts againſt the lives of Kings, the abominable trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons &amp; execrable plots and conſpiracies ſet on foot both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and without, have often been the dangerous effects of that damnable and bloudy doctrine.</p>
               <p>And to ſpeake truth, a State of a contrary Religion to theirs, is not ſecure where many of them thinke to have power, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have authoritie; for the Pope never faileth to have his Agents amongſt them, whereof they which are of any religious Order, are the moſt dangerous, becauſe they being Members of great companies, are men who have intelligence and factions; and beſides, they depending altogether on their Generalls, who (for the moſt part) are <hi>Italians,</hi> and engaged to the Pope, and they having made vow of obedience to him, what affection ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they beare towards their Princes, they dare not but further and advance the Intereſts of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> in every thing; for they are deſtinated to that end; and if they faile, they may expect to be blamed; and ſo they ought to be holden for ſpies and diligent inſtruments for the progreſſe of his deſignes; and matches and firebrands, which being not able to advance his Kingdome in time of peace, labour by all meanes to ſtirre up warres and diſſentions in Kingdomes and Common-wealths; to fiſh (as they ſay) in troubled waters, and effect in thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions that which they could not get done in time of peace; as it hath been wiſely remarked and propoſed in this preſent Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:156624:89"/>
not long agoe at a conference with the Lords, delivered by a rare and eminent man; and daily experience ſhould make that truth but too well knowne in this Kingdome. And I may ſpeake ſomething of it, for being in the Romiſh Church and beyond the Seas, I was twice ſpoken to come hither with another who was then profeſſour in Theologie, and that by a great Politician, who hath expreſſe Commiſſion from the Pope to ſend, and who was the onely Counſell of that notable Cardinall, who theſe fifteene yeares and above doth keepe in warres and troubles al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all Europe.</p>
               <p>But to come backe to our diſcourſe, if God by his providence did not hinder many, not ſuffering that abominable doctrine to be ſo eaſily beleeved of every one, as it is freely publiſhed, and if even by the mercy of God, there were not ſome generous and honeſt minds among them, lovers of concord and honour, who no wayes beleeving thoſe maximes, wou'd not for any thing in the world degenerate from the goodneſſe and generous diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their natures to engage themſelves in vile actions; wee would ſee worſe and more unhappie effects; for that is a bloudy doctrine, enemy of peace &amp; quietnes, and neither can, nor ought to be relliſhed by judicious men, who make profeſſion of honour; for we finde in no place that Chriſt and his Apoſtles did plant the faith of the Goſpell by fire and ſword, or that ever they aſſayed to extirminate all the idolatrous people by death and deſtroy them, that they might people their Lands with Chriſtians; but as there is great difference betwixt the doctrine of Chriſt, and the doctrine of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo are alſo their actions and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings very contrary.</p>
               <p>And I beleeve, if the noble and generous minds of that partie would take the pains diligently to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider theſe great differences and the deteſtable maximes of their Doctors, they would queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſſe abhor the doctrine that begetteth them; but the ſubtiltie of the Prieſts indeavour to ſtop their eares with an ignorant and blind faith to hinder them from receiving the inſtructions of the truth which are to be ſeen in the holy Scripture. Oh but I would thinke my labour well ſpent, if it would pleaſe the holy Spirit to touch the hearts of ſome one by the reading of this little Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, and make them ſee the blindnes wherein they endeavour to detaine them.</p>
               <p>I have ſet downe (it may be) divers things which may give
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:156624:90"/>
light to informe many, who living in darkneſſe, would not have been aware of their darkneſſe; and if any deſire a larger infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, I have written nothing, which I am not ready to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine by word, and give a more ample explanation for the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and profit of ſoules. If in ſome thing I have not cited many Authours in ſome points, I have done it purpoſely to ſhun prolixitie, and the things being common (amongſt the learned eſpecially) in the Romiſh Church, and others not being men to turne over the Bookes of thoſe which write thereof, I thought the number of citations would be needleſſe; and if any in the Romiſh Church, either out of ignorance or malice, inſult againſt mee, and tax me of any untruth; I promiſe to enlarge this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe with more proofes, and give cauſe to all men to confeſſe that I have written nothing untrue; but if the truth apparelled in this manner, hath been any way diſpleaſing to ſome, I cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that being otherwiſe trimmed, it will be more pleaſing.</p>
               <p>But to aſſure men the more, and confirme them in their reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they may have for the true faith, I ſay, that even although the difference of the doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> from the doctrine of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, ſhould not condemne her of untruth, it would be condemned by her workes; for our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſaith,<note place="margin">Mat. 7.17.</note> that <hi>the good or evill tree is knowne by its fruits;</hi> and though it did not appeare that the doctrine of the reformed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Church came neerer to the doctrine of Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, than that of the Romiſh Church, and ſo that ſhee ſhould be the true Spouſe of the Son of God, and ſhee with whom the ancient doctrine of Chriſt Jeſus hath been and is conſerved, and conſequently the perfecteſt alſo, that is, the ſureſt and beſt, and which onely ought to be termed Catholike, being the perfection of the beliefe and faith drawne from the conformitie with the doctrine of Chriſt; yet the fruits and works of both, ſhew ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently which is the beſt and ſureſt.</p>
               <p>For my part, I profeſſe that although I had not been allured and converted by the doctrine which I have found in the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Church, altogether conformable to the doctrine of Chriſt, which is not to be ſeen in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> the onely know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and compariſon of the works of the one and the other, was capable to worke this change in mee; and when after I was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a member of this Church, I did ſee with how much more holines God was worſhipped and ſerved, than in the Church of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:156624:90"/>
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> then it was, that with a great joy I had reaſon to ſay thoſe words of the Patriarch, <hi>In this place is the houſe of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 28.17.</note> 
                  <hi>and the gate of heaven:</hi> and have given millions of praiſes to my God for bringing me to a Church and a Land where his holy Name is ſo devoutly worſhipped, his Sacraments adminiſtred in ſuch purity, his Sabbath ſo holily kept, the Churches ſo carefully frequented, and kept ſo neatly and decently, and Divine Service ſo reverently done, and heard with ſo much ſilence.</p>
               <p>I know indeed that as God hath found fault with his Angels, and that being men it is impoſſible but ſome imputitie will ſlide into our actions, &amp; that Chriſtian Religion was never even in the time of the holy Apoſtles, but there was ſomething amiſſe, if not in doctrine at leaſt in the manners and practiſe of the faithfull; and that it is not here below, we can find the Spouſe of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Bridegroome without ſpot or wrinkle in all her actions, and that nothing in this world deſerveth the name of pure and perfect in compariſon with God, but onely in compariſon of one with another, and of the unclean thing with that which is not ſo unclean, and in leſſe or more drawing neer to the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, inſtitution, and intention of Chriſt Jeſus our good Maſter; ſo it is in that ſence, I praiſe the holineſſe of the Church I am in, for the preſent; that is, namely, in compariſon with the actions and practiſes of the Romiſh Church, which wanting true faith, cannot have true holineſſe.</p>
               <p>But the reformed Proteſtant Church retaining true faith which was preached by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, is alſo onely ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſanctity, and as that faith is the onely Catholike faith, ſo is the name of Catholike juſtly due to it, excluding all others, and the Romiſh Church not holding this faith, it cannot, nor ought to be holden for a Catholique Church, nor ought the Papiſts be called Catholiques.</p>
               <p>And now to begin the compariſon betwixt them by the houſe of God and Churches: if you enter in the Popiſh Churches, you may (it is true) ſee in moſt of them many fine pictures, rich car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, and rare inventions, ſome in Marble ſtone, ſome Jaſpar, ſome in Porphar, and other materials, where gold and azure are not wanting yee may obſerve alſo their ſtately architects &amp; great number of rich ornaments of all uſuall colours, of damask, ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, velvet, cloth of gold and ſilver, laid over and garniſhed with precious laces and embroyderings; there ye may find alſo many
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:156624:91"/>
veſſels, and utenſils, and boxes for reliques of gold and ſilver. In a word, a multitude of curious and ſumptuous objects, very fit to delight the eye, and which agree better with the ancient ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall Church, than with that of the Goſpel; and we may ſay all thoſe magnificences are but vanity before God, if it be not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with devotion;<note place="margin">Pſal. 45.14.</note> becauſe <hi>all the glory of the Kings daughter</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>is within, and in the heart:</hi> but that is much wanting in the Romiſh Church: for if you go into their Churches, eſpecially the Pariſh Churches in time of publique Service, ye ſhall ſee few that pray to God, or ſeem attentive to the myſteries, but many prating or doing worſe; here dogs play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there little children crying, while in the mean time ſome Prieſts are in ſinging for the moſt part confuſedly without reſpect or reverence, and things which almoſt none of the people under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and there is commonly ſuch a noiſe that it reſembleth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Market, than the houſe of God; this I ſay with that which followeth, for them who have not ſeen thoſe things.</p>
               <p>But in the reformed Churches, praiſed be God, it is not ſo, and I have received very great comfort and edification, ſeeing the ſilence which is kept there both before and in the time of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, how every one carrieth his Bible and book of Prayer to read them with the Miniſters, if they cannot hear; how everie one ſingeth devoutly and orderly without haſte or anticipation, endeavouring to ſmell and taſte the meaning of thoſe holy words; and if there be any thing to be further deſired in this, it is to follow the notes exactly to keep a greater uniformitie, as they do in the reformed Churches of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland;</hi> and to that end that the Clerks were Muſicians enough that they might be the more exact therein, and that the notes and tones were ſo eaſie that they might be the better ſung by all the people, as it is in other places. For it is true, that a devout and harmonious ſinging raiſeth the ſpirit much to God, and comforteth and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth glad the ſoul. Thence was it that the divine Pſalmiſt was wont to ſing his Pſalmes not only with his voice, but on the harp and organs, and other muſicall inſtruments, on which he exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to ſing and praiſe God as he did; but uſing them, or not uſing in the Church being not a point of faith, but of diſcipline onely, it ought wholly to be remitted to the diſpoſition of the Church, to which every one ought to joyn inſeparably, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelf in humilitie of ſpirit, ſo long as ſhe doth continue
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:156624:91"/>
orthodox, and we ought to beleeve that the aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt ſhall never be wanting to her in every point of diſcipline expedient for the ſalvation of the faithfull.</p>
               <p>And I will ſay further to the glory of God, and to the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Reader, that not onely in Churches, but even in private houſes, God is better ſerved than amongſt the Papiſts; for, amongſt them there are never any prayers almoſt in publike, and I remember ſeldome to have ſeen any ſuch thing practiſed in an infinite number of houſes, both of Nobles and others where I have been; but in the Reformed Churches, it is almoſt common amongſt the Nobles, and it is very ordinarily practiſed amongſt the people; and if there be any defect in that dutie, we may ſay the mixture and bad example of Papiſts hath been a great cauſe thereof here. But it is credible that all things will be amended by the zeal of this Honorable Parliament, and the diſcipline of the faithfull will be altogether throughly reformed, againſt all the imprecations of Arminians and Papiſts, falſe Prophets and ill fore-tellers of the confuſion which they doe wiſh to this Kingdome; but the Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches in <hi>France</hi> (which you may ſee Engliſhed) ſhew evidently, that good and happy order may be eſtabliſhed in Church-government without ſuch connivances with Popiſh faſhions.</p>
               <p>Now let us come to the ſolemnities of the Sabbaths and holy dayes: it is certain that the Pope minding more the profit of his Prieſts than the ſalvation of his flock, hath inſtituted too many holidayes in the Romiſh Church, to the great hurt (queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe) of poore people, who cannot conveniently be ſo often idle, but hath need to work more to gain their living; and therefore complain often; and the inſtitution of God hath been very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet in ordering ſix dayes to labour, and the ſeventh to reſt, and ſpend the ſame in his ſervice; and if in ſome places of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches the people be commanded to keep cloſe their ſhops ſome other dayes through policie; that is onely to give ſome time of recreation to the Apprentiſes, and thoſe who are not in libertie, not under any precept of ſin or damnation, as doth the Pope and the Romiſh Church, to keep holy dayes as ſtrictly as the Sundayes; but onely under ſome pain or pecunia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie penaltie; and we ſee that in the Romiſh Church the holidaies
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:156624:92"/>
and Sundayes being of equall obligation, they are obſerved equally, that is very evill; for they will go (it may be) to ſome Monaſtery, if there be any, or to ſome other place, and heare a little Maſſe for a quarter or half an houre, which they hear even for the moſt part very irreverently, and onely for faſhions ſake, and becauſe it is commanded under pain of ſin; and this is all the ſanctification the moſt part give to holy dayes and Sabbaths in that which concerneth the worſhip; and in the time of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Service, which is of the great Maſſe, the Mattins, and Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, in towns where they may have half-houre Maſſes at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, there is almoſt no body in Pariſh Churches but the Prieſt and ſome few women and folk, whom they terme commonly Image-eaters, and ſuperſtitieux; the reſt of the time is ſpent ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Tavernes, which are open all the day long, or at games and paſtimes, which are publiquely ſuffered, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly frequented more freely on the Sabbaths, which God from his owne mouth hath commanded to be ſanctified, than on a holiday of their devotion, which is onely commanded by the Pope.</p>
               <p>And what can be ſaid here, but that it is to make void the commandment of God for a humane invention and tradition, and account more of the commandments and precepts of men than of the commandments of God? Oh happie are the people which have the Lord onely for their God, by whoſe Word they ſtrive to be ruled, and directed in every thing; and which ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe the whole Sabbath with all the reſpect and devotion they are able.</p>
               <p>Which I ſeeing ſo faithfully obſerved in this Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and beſides that the Service of God was ſo reverently celebrated, the Churches ſo much frequented of all Noble and ignoble, rich and poore; I confeſſe I often thanked and do thank my God, for having delivered me out of the captivitie of Aegypt, and from that Idolatrous people, among whom I lived imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in gathering of ſtraws, and in unprofitable works; for having (I ſay) delivered me with a ſtrong hand in deſpight of all the enterpriſes and power of the enemies of the truth, for having brought me through the ſeas confounding and drowning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all the induſtrie and purſuing of mine enemies, and bringing me to this Land flowing with the milk and honey of heavenly
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:156624:92"/>
and earthly bleſſings, to this Countrey of <hi>Sion,</hi> and this <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> and place of peace, whereas the Goſpel is preached in greater puritie, ſo the Service of God is celebrated with greater perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and reverence than in any Kingdom of the world, and is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yet to be better, by the care and zeal of this thrice worthie Senate.</p>
               <p>It is true, that as the bodies are compoſed of divers members, and of different qualities and conditions; ſo all they which are of the reformed Church are not Saints: and there are ſome vices to be found in many, and doubtleſſe but too many; and if I dare not ſay few, yet I may ſay truly not neer ſo many as in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church, as well in that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> concerneth the ſervice of God, as in that which concerneth the policie both of Eccleſiaſticall and Civill; for it hath often been obſerved, and I have ſeen it with my eyes, the famous Cities, yea, and States, governed by thoſe of the reformed Churches, did live in good order and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, which after being falne into the hands of Popiſh governors, (commonly greater friends of their particular profit than of the glory of their Princes, and the publique peace and good) have in a ſhort time loſt their felicitie and proſperitie, and changed their good policie into confuſion and diſorder; this truth is known to many more than to me.</p>
               <p>And if one will but look upon this Noble Kingdom, and all the States, eſpecially which enjoy peace under Princes and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of the Reformed Religion, and likewiſe on the States which are governed by thoſe of the Romiſh Church, eſpecially on thoſe which are under the dominion of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and over whom he domineereth with greateſt authoritie, there is no man who will not ſee the great difference; and they who have been in <hi>Italy,</hi> and have any knowledge of the government of the Popes territories, know ſufficiently what compariſon there is betwixt the policie of the one with the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ye ſhall know</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>the tree by its fruits:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 7.20.</note> and they who produce ſuch fruits of confuſion and diſorder, ought not in my opinion, nor cannot be thought good trees; and as trees bring forth good or bad fruits according to the proportion of ſap which they draw from the earth which giveth them both life and action; ſo muſt we beleeve that the government of people followeth commonly the doctrine and beleefe which animateth
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:156624:93"/>
them, and where we ſee thoſe diſorders, that it is not the ſpirit and doctrine of truth which governeth them; for Juſtice, Order, and Peace are his inſeparable companions; but rather the ſpirit of errour, which being a friend of diſorder, produceth nothing but the like fruits and effects, and every where bringeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</p>
               <p>And if it happen that any States leaving the beleefe of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church embrace the Reformed, you ſee incontinent their government totally altred, their policie to be changed to the better, and all things eſtabliſhed in better order; and as States and Provinces following this doctrine of the infallible truth, are kept and maintained in better order and policie, ſo ordinarily alſo do they flouriſh in greater luſtre and glory, in greater wealth and proſperitie.</p>
               <p>And I may ſay likewiſe, that the Princes even of that beleef have ſeldome found more faithfull and affectionate ſubjects and ſervants than thoſe of the Reformed Religion, both in peace and war; and howſoever they have ſometimes ſuffered oppreſſions, nevertheleſſe, the murthers and infamous attempts and perfidious treaſons againſt the State, or the perſons of their Lords, have been little found amongſt their practiſes; But they have often ſhewed they had rather ſuffer perſecutions with patience, than abandon themſelves to infamous actions, unworthie of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and doctrine of Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Thoſe States alſo who are not ſo faſt bound and tied to the intereſts of the Pope, having no cauſe to complain nor diſtruſt their practiſes, and even ſeeing much publique good to follow upon their managing, and good and wiſe governing, beſides that they often imploy many of them in important occaſions, and of very great truſt, they gratifie them yet ſo much as to ſuffer them, judging themſelves in ſafety and ſecurity with them, not miſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they can receive any hurt from them; becauſe thoſe Churches having the Law and Word of God for rule of their faith, they have it alſo for ſquare of their life, endeavouring to conform their actions thereunto, and commit nothing which may dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from the condition of the faithfull: which I write more willingly as knowing it even from the confeſſion of their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt enemies,<note place="margin">Deut. 33.31.</note> ſo as we may ſay that of the Cantique, <hi>&amp; inimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci noſtri ſunt judices, Our enemies are Judges of it:</hi> and I my ſelfe
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:156624:93"/>
have heard it oftentimes from the moſt judicious of the Romiſh Church.</p>
               <p>And if the Romaniſts would carry themſelves with ſo great modeſtie and fidelity towards the Princes and States under which they deſire to live, they ſhould receive (queſtionleſſe) the ſame kindneſſe and gratification; but as their doctrine is much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, ſo are often the effects; not but amongſt them there are found many noble and generous minds, lovers of tranquillitie and peace, and of the glory and proſperitie of the States in which they remain: But becauſe the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> who is never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with his own, but is inſatiable of wealth as be all his Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, keepeth continually a congregation of Cardinals of purpoſe by him, which borrow the name and pretext <hi>De propaganda fide,</hi> for increaſing the faith; but indeed hearkneth to nothing more affectionately than to the means of ſetling and increaſing the power and dominion of the Pope, and conſequently to augment the revenues and profits of the Clergie, eſpecially that of <hi>Rome;</hi> and to that end ſendeth continually abroad, and entertaineth ſo many agents as he is able amongſt his adverſaries, to whom he giveth commiſſion to uſe all means, and leave nothing unattempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the increaſing of his Empire there, promiſing them great recompence if they have good ſucceſſe in their deſignes, and if by chance they fall into the ſnares which they have laid for others, and find themſelves catched in the gins of deſtruction which they would have prepared for others, and die or be taken in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of their enterpriſes, they ſhall be holden and eſteemed Martyrs, and written up in the Catalogue of the Saints; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they die as Traitors, and diſobedient, and refractory to the Princes and States, to which they owe obedience and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; notwithſtanding they ſhall be reputed as dead for the faith, and for the glory of the Goſpel, to which their doctrine is ſo contrary as well as their actions.</p>
               <p>And on thoſe frivolous hopes, a number of ſilly fooles have engaged themſelves in ſo deſperate actions and execrable enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes, that the onely thinking on them would fright Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, very far queſtionleſſe from the modeſty which is required in the ſpirits of Chriſtians; as hath been often enough ſeen in this Kingdome; eſpecially in that damnable conſpiracy of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Treaſon, forged rather in the Devills ſhop than in the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:156624:94"/>
braines of men, but diſcovered and brought to naught by the providence and bountie of God, who hath manifeſted himſelfe ſo clearely in this and many other occaſions both before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to watch in the protection of this State ſince the time of the reformation, that it is not to be doubted, but he would thereby ſhew, that as this people was his people, his Nation and heritage, ſo would he teſtifie himſelfe to be their God. And notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pope and his Suppoſts, have laboured often both before and after that, as well by open force, as by ſecret conſpiracies and hidden enterpriſes, to involve this whole State in ruine. Nevertheleſſe, his Inſtruments and Agents have ever loſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and all have falne out to their ſhame and confuſion: As I hope all thoſe Rebells Papiſts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who at this preſent are up in Armes againſt their Prince and the faithfull, in all crueltie and execrations, will doe one of theſe dayes; ſo that it may be truly ſaid this of the <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.9.<note place="margin">Pſal. 147.9.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord hath not dealt ſo with all the Nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But God having continually ſhewed himſelfe ſo good and mercifull to this his people, it is their part to bleſſe him with their whole heart, and render him eternall thankeſgiving; and my part alſo, who deſire that favour to be holden a member thereof the reſt of my life, to joyne with them, and offer alſo to that good God the ſacrifices of praiſes and thankeſgiving, which I doe with my whole heart, praying him continually to ſhew himſelfe the God, Protectour, Saviour, and the Ruler of his poore people, and that he would continue to powre out upon them all heavenly and earthly bleſſings, and preſerve the puritie and ſinceritie of his holy Word among them; and if there be any thing wanting, or to be purged in their practiſe and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, that he would cleanſe them from all filth and Tares, which might in time corrupt the good graine; that he would make that order and pollicy to ſhine amongſt them which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to him, and which he hath inſtituted and taught by his Apoſtles; that he would alſo impart the ſame favours to all the Churches and Nations where his holy Name is called upon; that he would bleſſe the Princes which governe and maintaine them, and draw and bring to his fold, all the ſoules which are gone aſtray in any part of the world; that he would open their eyes, and let them ſee their blindneſſe and errour, and bring
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:156624:94"/>
them to the ſight and knowledge of the truth, and of the pure and perfect beliefe, which is left and taught to us in his Word; that being but one Fould and one Flocke, under one ſole Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour Chriſt our Saviour and Maſter, wee may all of us ſerve Him in holineſſe and juſtice, in peace and union the reſt of our dayes, and hereafter wee may enjoy eternall happineſſe, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to whom with the eternall Father, and glorious Spirit, be all honour, praiſe, and glory, might, majeſtie, and dominion, now and for evermore, AMEN.</p>
